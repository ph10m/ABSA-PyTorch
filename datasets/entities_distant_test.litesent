Coming off a title win at the season-ending ATP Finals in London, Zverev countered his 45 unforced errors with 39 winners and eight aces to beat Spanish veteran David Ferrer 6-4 4-6 7-6-LRB-0-RRB-. After the match, Zverev paid tribute to former world number three Ferrer, who will retire from the sport next year. All the credit is -LRB-to-RRB- David, coming back from a set down and break down, Zverev said. He is the greatest fighter, maybe, that we have ever seen in tennis.

When individuals buy real estate, even if they do so using loans or other $T$ money, they can depreciate -- or write off, over time -- the cost of the physical property on their taxes. Suppose, for example, that a taxpayer bought a $2 million building as an investment. He would be able to deduct, or subtract from his taxes, something like $100,000 a year for 20 years to defray the costs of buying and improving the property. The taxpayer would be able to take these deductions even if the building were going up in value. This is why Donald Trump loves depreciation, as he told the nation during a presidential debate in 2016 -- it's one of many ways he avoided paying millions in taxes.

A large surface rock could sit in the way. One of the legs might not release and lock. Those scenarios, though unlikely, are not implausible. Any of them could cause an erratic landing. If the lander were to tip over, says Grover, it doesn't have the ability to right itself. We would be stuck in that position. The science would be very difficult to do. Not helping any of this The probe touches down during dust storm season. A global dust storm can blow up in a matter of days, acknowledges Grover. We've been rehearsing for that, he says.

Inferences do help $T$ establishing a tenet, but ideas seem half-baked and are too generalised. More importantly, as the author tries to shift focus from one technology to another, he completely misses out on delving deeper into the issues and only addresses them superficially. Generalised statements like there will be a need for new organising principles or structures for families, industries, and countries do not provide any insight into what these structures or organising principles might be. One of the critical problems with inferencing is assuming that our society would behave like the western one, which has proved to be a fallacy as far as interactions with technology are concerned. Thus, the work does not do justice to the idea of decoding the future. Also, the report-like writing becomes boring and repetitive, because of which the reader is bound to lose interest.

President Trump instructed the Department of Energy to purchase oil for the reserves earlier this month but the U.S. government is still trying to determine how to finance the purchasing operation.

$T$ need not say anymore. The cherry for bizarre goes to the renewed fight against corruption.

It results in a misallocation of resources and shaves a few basis points off our GDP every year. It also increases the costs of doing business and makes us an undesirable investment destination. While the renewal of efforts to fight corruption is a good thing, its bizarre that the we have had to bypass all the established anti-corruption organs and move the fight to Plot Entebbe.

ASSOCIATED PRESS As of today, $T$ of U.S. governors have issued statewide stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders in an effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, but President Trump says he's not inclined to order a national travel ban. It's pretty unlikely at this time, said the president during today's coronavirus task force press briefing in the White House Rose Garden. We're letting the governors do in their states pretty much what they want, with our supervision. Obviously, there are parts of the country that are in far deeper trouble than others, he said. Other parts are frankly not in trouble at all and hopefully we're going to be able to keep it that way by doing what we're doing. Since Saturday, a majority of governors have issued executive orders mandating that residents stay at home. As pressure has mounted on the holdouts, the total number of states in shutdown mode has risen to 32.

Lee Konstantinou, writing for The Los Angeles Review of Books , sums up the situation thus Both publishing and $T$ Gaddis's novel suggests, are paper empires,' enterprises heinously, hilariously bad at what they do, and bad in similar ways. Both have subordinated their alleged functions rationally allocating capital optimally connecting readers and writers to reckless speculation.

The 1MDB investigation has quickened since $T$ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad returned to power in May. Tun Dr Mahathir has called former premier Najib Razak, who set up the fund in 2009, a thief and made resolving the case one of his priorities. Several arrest warrants - including one for Mr Low, described by prosecutors as a key figure in the plot - have already been issued. Dr Mahathir said in a June 22 Bloomberg Television interview that Malaysia is also seeking to recoup some of the almost US$600 million in fees Goldman made from the three deals, which were arranged by the bank's London-based unit. What we earned from the debt transactions reflected the risks we assumed at the time, specifically movement in credit spreads tied to the specific bonds, hedging costs and underlying market conditions, Mr Naylor, the Goldman spokesman, said last week in response to Dr Mahathir's comments. Datuk Seri Najib has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and called the probe political revenge.

$T$ than 40 cities, half of them in California, have implemented their own minimum wages, reflecting the increasing costs of living in numerous country's most economically dynamic areas. The EPI, which has tracked minimum wage data for the past eight years, analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau's monthly Current Population Survey and projected that minimum wage increases will come as a result of changing policies across the U.S. For the rest of the state, including upstate counties, the new minimum wage will be $11.10 an hour, an increase of 70 cents. Millions of workers are due for a raise next year. Wages will increase gradually each year for the next five years, according to the state. I think it's also fair to say the hopes of what a minimum wage .

a good kind of entertainment, Mr Putin told state-owned news channel Russia $T$ I think this is a well-justified reason to play hockey ahead of the new year. Read more Mr Putin had initially told press he hoped he would be joined on the ice by authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, with whom he had held talks in the Russian capital earlier that day. Mr Lukashenko should be home in Minsk to solve lots of issues, routine issues. There are always loads of them before the new year, he later told state-controlled news agency Tass. However, we struck a deal that we would play together and go skiing once we met. Mr Putin typically makes at least one public appearance a year in which he will take part in a game of ice hockey, Russia's second most popular sport after football. The 66-year-old president has also regularly taken the opportunity to display his prowess in other disciplines during his time in power. Mr Putin holds a black belt in judo and his martial arts .

Not just Initially Bauer was supposed to ski a few races, but he has realized that it is tough to combine the team director role with the role as an athlete. My previous plan was to ski a couple of the big races, like Marcialonga and Vasaloppet. But then I realised that it's not the best for the athletes. In the most prestigious races I am even more needed. So this coming season I might not race at all. Bauer has won Tour de Ski twice and have five medals from the Olympics and the World Championships. His last visit on the podium was in 2015, when he was second on the 50 K classic race in Falun. He switched to long distance skiing in the end of his professional career.

The San Francisco $T$ fired its first volley, suggesting that banks get extra credit for climate-adaptation loans under the Community Reinvestment Act.

They should entreat the body constitutionally vested with law-making authority Congress to address the issue. If they simply want to express their green piety, the Union Theological Seminary would be a more appropriate venue. The CRA helped cause the financial crisis by incentivizing banks to make risky loans. Incorporating climate change as a criterion would make it far worse. The act should be repealed, not expanded by a lawless edict from the administrative state.

Champ hits the ball harder than anyone on the PTA Tour, with his swing speed approaching 130 mph and ball speed around 192 mph. The 23-year-old started his rookie season on the tour in fine fashion with a win at the Sanderson Farms Championship.

Americans are more glum now than they were during the Great Recession, according to the $T$ Well-Being Index. -LRB-Washington Post-RRB- I think one reason people may be anxious is because the government itself seems to be in disarray, said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. We don't know what is going to happen next. There's no clear path toward stabilizing either the country or the world. The index also breaks down its findings by race, income and gender. Almost every demographic group dropped in well-being in 2017 - except for wealthy, white men. Women, African Americans, Hispanics and lower-income households -LRB-those earning less than $48,000 a year-RRB- all saw substantial drops in their perception of their well-being. Not surprisingly, Democrats also showed far bigger declines than Republicans or Independents. Switching out the person in the Oval Office can and does have an effect on well-being, said Witters.

Billions of dollars are being invested and new laws are being enacted to support development of autonomous vehicles, but challenges still abound. One answer might be to restrict self-driving cars to routes with controlled intersections, but this address other dangers such as safely driving across sidewalks to access driveways. Cities could reconfigure infrastructure to suit self-driving cars, but only at an exorbitant cost. A far cheaper path would involve restricting pedestrians and bikes from all access routes that intersect public roads. But that would be a recipe for conflict. So how will cities and this new technology adapt to each other An interim technology such as Level 4 autonomy could help.

By 2021, WWE will be making more than $540 million per year for Raw and SmackDown in TV rights fees alone, and the company could rake in close to $100 million per year for $T$ for the next two years. Given the significant drops in TV ratings that WWE has experienced for Raw -LRB-down and SmackDown -LRB-down over the course of the past year, whatever the creative team has been doing just won't cut it as both NBCUniversal and FOX will have lofty expectations for their respective shows moving forward. In recent months, the quality of WWE's programming has been all over the place Some weeks, it's very good, but other weeks, it's, well, not. WWE will need to produce more consistently entertaining programming in both the immediate and long-term futures, and that may necessitate a series of wholesale adjustments to the way WWE produces and books its product.

Perhaps more significant than the future promise is that China's zinc smelters are sufficiently worried about the market to have held Thursday's meeting in the first place.

The company has three bike stores across Germany, and currently has an annual profit of around 50,000 -LRB-$56,000-RRB-.

In 2013 we have the support of a partner - the Yonso Project - to build the first small production facility and we trained the first 10 workers.

This means no new $T$ investments in fertilizer industry which bodes well for existing players in the long term.

Under-investment in new production facilities and low interest rate environment is likely to pave way for another commodity bubble once the coronavirus headwind is behind us. Also, with low valuations currently, there might be a renewed interest in in this sector. Most of the investors following fertilizer sector closely must remember BHP Billiton's hostile bid for Potash Corp in 2010. Mosaic was not in play at that time because of Cargill's majority stake .

Breaking someone in this instance is equal to success.

Red post-budget opinion poll showed that 73 per cent of people believe the Government was doing enough to tackle the housing crisis. On October 3rd and again on December 1st thousands of people marched through the streets of Dublin to highlight the growing levels of housing need. In response the Government tells us that supply is the answer. Until both the public and private sectors build more homes, the crisis will continue.

His mother has handled a lot of the responsibilities, and he has worked with a marketing executive. And that was probably a savvy play on his part, as rookie contracts are locked in anyway. But these negotiations are different. One league source said it appears that Brown will retain an agent for these talks. The problem for Brown is that he has not really shown statistical improvement over his three seasons. His per-36-minute numbers are almost identical.

They wrote in a research note People are adapting to a more local existence and living off more sustainable activities, consuming less globally produced fresh food, producing less waste with a more $T$ approach to consumption, all of which may have lasting impacts on demand. In addition, oil companies may find the cost of reopening fields and wells makes it uneconomic to do so, the researchers forecast. While oil prices are low today and physical constraints are forcing the behavioural changes, as oil shortages develop once economic activity normalises, the high oil prices will likely accelerate the energy transition by constraining demand. For example, commuting and jet demand destruction may still be needed to cope with the supply shortage that is likely to occur once significant supply capacity is hampered. Higher oil prices would also greatly improve the relative economics of EVs electric vehicles and hydrogen. Read more MPs' pension fund still investing in oil despite climate emergency

A bad Christmas for retailers Unemployment is at its lowest since the mid-70s and wages are rising faster than prices again.

Households ran down their savings to finance spending when their real incomes were being squeezed by higher inflation. They may now be deciding to save more and spend less. The housing market Every measure of the residential property market is telling the same story. Fewer homes are changing hands and prices are heading south.

$T$ Stocks End Month Negative as Global Trade Tussle Heats Up.

We saw a post-apartheid president, careful in his deliberations not to call for a state of emergency - that horrid tool of apartheid - but instead proclaimed a state of disaster.

Sloane, a Los Angeles-based business executive, appeared before U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani for his Tuesday afternoon sentencing at John Joseph Moakley U.S. The founder of water company, WaterTALENT, pleaded guilty in May to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, officials said at the time. In 2017, Sloane allegedly bought a swimming cap and water polo gear on Amazon and then photographed his oldest son in a pool making water polo poses, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen during court appearance. Sloane then had the images doctored and sent them to William Rick Singer, whom he paid $250,000 to have his son fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California as an athlete. The crimes did not end at the infinity pool, Rosen said.

If you want to buy online, $T$ may be a good way to go so long as you keep your eyes open for scams and use a safe payment method. -LRB-No wire transfers, people.-RRB- Some of you might disagree, but there really is no reason to spend a lot of money on a brand-new pet from a breeder when plenty of preloved -LRB-or not so loved-RRB- animals need homes. My local animal shelter and Humane Society regularly have free or almost-free adoption days, during which you can get dogs and cats, as well as other pets, from bunnies to birds. Your local shelter might offer the same. Unless planning to show your pet, spending hundreds or even thousands on a purebred animal is probably not money well spent. The $50 puppy from the pound is just as likely as the $500 puppy from a breeder to smother you with wet kisses and stare at you with unbridled adoration. What do you never buy new Share with us .

A large part of me thinks that the big Chinese reformers sitting behind President Xi $T$ won't be overly upset with some aspects of this because they want to do further changes possibly more substantive than the ones that happened ten years ago, when that -LRB-financial-RRB- shock told them that they couldn't afford to have over 10 percent of their GDP in exports to the U.S., O'Neill said. So I suspect that this will result in accelerated genuine domestic reforms in China which are good for the world. The second thing I would say is that it's clear to me that there are some rational people around somewhere in Washington and there will be some point where Trump either backs off because he gets some token gesture that he can sell to his domestic voters or they know that it could end up causing a lot of damage and self-inflict problems not just for the economy, but for the himself.

I had long wondered why the yields on US T-bonds and the yields on $T$ and European sovereign bonds would not converge. The conventional theory is that when interest rates are relatively high in country A, then investors in country B should buy the bonds of country A, lowering the yield in country A and raising the value of country A's currency. Over the last 12 months, this did in fact happen with respect to the US and the Eurozone. Our dollar rose relative to the euro, our T-bond yields fell, and so our T-bond prices rose. But the Eurozone sovereign bond yields did not rise despite the euro dropping in value. In fact, the Eurozone bond yields dropped a lot. The yield on the 10-year German bund fell by 112 basis points in 12 months as of The yield of the 10-year US T-bond fell 136 basis points. So there was a little convergence, but not much. Why did European investors accept negative yields on their sovereign bonds while the US 10-year T-bond had a positive yield of 2 or higher.

Progress included consolidating $T$ territory under a single authority and converting the government into an increasingly public political structure. Initially, the new Meiji government was bankrupt and adopted a three-pronged strategy of increasing revenue, cutting expenditure, and creating the institutions of a market economy. One of the earliest actions of the new Meiji government was to order a specie-minting machine from the UK in 1868. Several officials at the Ministry of Finance had visited the US to study their banking system and recommended that Japan adopt the same. Some of the currency in Japan at the time of the Meiji Restoration had its value assigned to it by the government. This was considered quite advanced at the time. In the initial response to the influx of Western thought, ideals and models there was an urgent program to transform thought and opinion. The new government was determined to mobilise the nation and boldly encouraged rapid change.

As a direct result of this, there has a been a resounding and notable failure of modern society to introduce chaos and disruption into our lives, and as things become more convenient and safe, our ability to understand, overcome and articulate our human experience suffers.

Zarathustra was a wise hermit, who inhabited a mythological land and delivered his wisdom to crowds, followers and passers-by in a series of sermons throughout the book.

ONE LAST IDEA .If there are any documents, contacts, files, etc. you want from your current employer be sure you have gotten all that copied off your computer before you give notice. You'll instantly lose access and some of that info may be useful in the new job. Copy it, and put it on a backup drive or on a HOME or personal computer.

Bautista had won the first 11 races of the season to build a 61-point lead over Rea, but crashes at four consecutive rounds in Spain, Italy, Great Britain and the United States dealt a serious blow to the Ducati rider's chances.

To help local $T$ centers, Simpsons Printing, in Rapid City, has been brainstorming ideas on creating face shields. It's a simple design, featuring a plastic shield that covers the entire face. Shielding eyes, nose, and mouth from pathogens. As of now several tech and printing companies are working on similar projects. Meaning the mask materials are in high demand. Due to a shortage of materials to make the masks, Simpsons is currently unable to mass produce their idea. If they can straighten out the wrinkles with the prototype and purchase supplies when they are in stock, Simpsons is more than happy to help. I think locally all of the businesses, we're rooting for Monument, we're rooting for all of the healthcare providers, says vice president, Jonathan Simpson.

Some reports said that $T$ banks had been told to withhold lira funds, which could have been used to speculate against the currency. The government has also been operating markets that offer a limited range of foods at lower prices. The food markets may help some hard-pressed families, but it is not going to yield a durable solution to Turkey's inflation problem. As for the steps to stabilise the currency, there is a great deal of scepticism. Dennis Shen of the credit rating group Scope said Such tactics to force lira stability and restrict selling of the lira may reduce speculative pressures to an extent in the short run, but will make lira less attractive longer-term, cutting foreign direct investment and external portfolio and debt flows into Turkey.

Part of that is because $T$ and the US in general, doesn't have a supply chain set up for making consumer electronics at scale the way it does automobiles.

In a recent fireside chat, Apple CEO Tim Cook told Fortune that the reason Apple works with China is because the country's people excel in highly skilled tooling environments and labor-intensive vocations. In the US you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I'm not sure we could fill the room, he commented. In China, you could fill multiple football fields.

The $T$ Network will implement the electronic way bill to track cargo movements across state borders as well as within states from April 1. While the earlier attempt to introduce the mechanism failed on February 1 due to a deficient system, it is expected that it could raise the monthly revenue collection by a substantial Rs 10,000 crore. The e-way bill mechanism is an anti-evasion measure to plug revenue leakages in business-to-consumer -LRB-B2C-RRB- transactions. This is monetarily a more important measure than invoice-matching system in the return filing process, which targets evasion in business-to-business -LRB-B2B-RRB- transactions, a tax official told FE. He added that the government was expecting about Rs 10,000 crore more from e-way bill and close to Rs 3,000 crore from invoice-matching. But experts say that there is still no clarity on when the new return-filing system with invoice-matching provisions will be finalised and implemented.

People are reluctant to abandon familiar energy sources Unfortunately for fans of the Virgin Queen $T$ diktat, the story is untrue. The transition from wood to coal in Elizabethan England did not occur by Royal declaration, but because wood became too expensive for everyday use.

And it until the 1620s several decades after Queen Elizabeth reign that coal actually overtook wood as the primary heating fuel in the kingdom. The verifiably true history of energy transitions is that they are slow, gradual processes driven by market economics and weighed down by massive amounts of inertia and decades-long lags.

What is causing America to turn differences into these bitter hatreds and why now The $T$ and social media often descend into an electronic lynch mob.

Speed is also the enemy of common sense and restraint.

Under the just-enacted $2.2 trillion package, a government watchdog and a panel appointed by Congress will monitor how the billions in aid are deployed and whether its corporate recipients are meeting the restrictions.

Conclusion Pinterest remains a risky play due to the nature of the $T$ market, its inability to generate any profits as of yet, and its higher average cost of advertising on its platform. Many small businesses use Pinterest as their mode of advertisement, but if their finances are struck down by the coronavirus outbreak, their ability to advertise on Pinterest might change.

The company needs to be able to generate more revenues from its international segment by increasing ARPU significantly and prove that it can do it soon. Pinterest's revenue streams may not push it to profitability with the next fiscal year or two, and the business model comes with significant risks to performance.

A closer analogy would be to compare them to German concentration-camp guards, who when tried for war crimes advanced the argument that they were not motivated by race hatred. They were simply, dutifully, mindlessly following orders. They had no opinion either way. This analogy also fails because the guards were lying. Algorithms think you have a conversation with one.

What we're doing is very similar, but the big difference is, we're using the $T$ as a reaction vessel, so our capital cost is a lot lower, and instead of buying natural gas to fuel it, we use the unswept oil in the reservoir as our fuel. Through lab work and small-scale field testing, the researchers say they found injecting oxygen into the fields raises the temperature and creates a reaction that frees the hydrogen. You can envision that the reservoir is simply a hot, bubbling mix of oil, which some fraction of it is now combusting, said professor Ian Gates, from his lab at the University of Calgary's Schulich School of Engineering. And as it is doing so, it simply keeps producing more and more hydrogen as a consequence of its reactions.

Earlier this month, the BoE said Britain's top banks and insurers should be tested together for the first time in 2021 to quantify the potential financial damage from climate change on their businesses.

Unfortunately, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spent the first half of the 2010s doing exactly what both theory and history told them not to do. And this wrong turn on policy cast a long shadow, economically and politically. In particular, the deficit obsession of 2010-2015 helped set the stage for the current crisis of democracy. Why is austerity in a depressed economy a bad idea Because an economy is not like a household, whose income and spending are separate things. In the economy as a whole, my spending is your income and your spending is my income. What happens if everyone tries to cut spending at the same time, as was the case in the aftermath of the financial crisis Everyone's income falls.

You want to build a life that relies only on one $T$ of satisfaction. Because someday the music will inevitably stop. As with your financial investments, you need a diversification strategy for your life. I spent years in graduate school toiling in the lab doing experiments. And, in my field of study -LRB-biology-RRB-, things are notoriously hard to figure out. Some weeks were very rough. I would spend 12 hours in the lab every day, come in on the weekends, turn down social invitations, and still get nowhere in my work. On the other hand, when things were good, they were really good. But it was hard to predict. From one week to the next, I might be loving life or hating life. It was often completely out of my control. I finally learned that I rely only on my work to be my only metric for success and happiness. I let this dictate how I was doing. It was too much pressure. Otherwise, it was like putting all of my expectations in a proven con man.

There was talk that a later start date to the Olympics was in play and if that was the case, Canada's NBA $T$ involvement, as well as that of the USA team, would be in jeopardy much as it was last summer at the FIBA World Cup. The IOC's decision to schedule the Games for July 23-Aug 8 in 2021 should alleviate any concerns of players bailing because it's too close to training camp. The only concern to NBA participation next summer would be a change in the NBA schedule. There already has been plenty of talk about moving the season back permanently to lessen the overlap with the NFL and take their chances with regular season baseball as competition for ticket buyers and TV ratings rather than the world-swallowing NFL reach. If that occurs, these dates could be either too close to the end of the season or overlap the NBA playoffs. But assuming there's no radical schedule shift, this has to be viewed as a good thing for NBA participation.

This is cheap for a search engine with a monopoly position in $T$ combined with a fast growing AI business. There are definitely risks, though, We believe iQiyi could drag down Baidu's valuation for quite a while. The company is still in investment mode, so it'll likely not see profitability for a while, and it's facing headwinds that will likely depress revenue growth. iQiyi's growing losses will reduce Baidu's profitability and turn off some investors, which could depress Baidu's valuation for a fairly long period of time. It doesn't help that the advertising market is also in a slowdown, and this also affect's Baidu's revenues, though reliance continues to decline as Baidu diversifies its revenue streams. Takeaway Overall, while Baidu has appreciated substantially from its lows, we still think there could be significant upside if Baidu executes on its AI initiatives, while downside is protected due to its low valuation and holdings in other companies.
