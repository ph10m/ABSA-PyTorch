In fact, XLF's losing streak only broke Thursday, with the barest bounce XLF's extended free fall, the longest the fund has ever had, underscores just how nervous investors are feeling about the financials sector right now, and about XLF in particular. Since June 11, investors have pulled more than $1.5 billion from the fund. As of June 28, XLF was down 3.61 year-to-date.

Adapting to the new law, which meant doing things like repatriating money from abroad, caused losses at $T$ and Goldman Sachs that depleted their capital going into the stress tests. Because of the one-time nature of the losses, and the fact that the tax cuts will bolster earnings over time, the Fed did not object to the two banks plans. As for Deutsche Bank, it has had years to try and mend the problems affecting its U.S. businesses before they were subject to the stress tests. But on Thursday, the Fed said it objected to the capital plan of Deutsche U.S. entity, known as DB USA, because of widespread and critical deficiencies across the capital planning practices.

Sign up San Wells Fargo did well Thursday when the $T$ released results of its annual stress tests, which assess whether large banks have enough capital to make it through an economic crisis, and whether they have the systems and plans in place to deal with the related upheaval.
Federal Reserve System

$T$ last week said that all of the 35 banks it tested had sufficient capital to absorb the losses that might occur in the hypothetical crisis. Because banks are earning big profits right now, the first round of stress tests raised hopes that banks would be allowed to pay out most of those profits to shareholders when the test turned Thursday to their operational capabilities.
Federal Reserve System

$T$ only objected to the capital payouts of a U.S. entity belonging to Deutsche Bank, which includes its large Wall Street operations. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley did not fail Thursday, but their pass came with restrictions. The stress tests were introduced after the financial crisis of 2008, and most experts agree that made the big banks safer. The most common way of measuring a strength is to look at its capital levels.
Federal Reserve System

As the $T$ noted Thursday, the 35 banks in the stress test had more than $1.2 trillion of capital at the end of 2017, an increase of approximately $800 billion since 2009.

In proposed changes to the stress tests and capital requirements, the $T$ has suggested removing a measure of capital, known as the supplementary leverage ratio, that some banks find hard to meet. This will make the stress tests less stressful, said Gregg Gelzinis, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Wells recent scandals did not appear to hold it back in the stress tests.

Nor did the stringent regulatory action the $T$ imposed on the bank this year, which included a cap on its growth.
Federal Reserve System

Wells Fargo, having passed the stress tests, on Thursday announced that the $T$ had signed off its plan to initiate roughly $33 billion in stock buybacks and dividends, more than double the amount approved after last test. That payout would be 40 percent more than earnings analysts expect Wells Fargo to make in the second half of this year and the first half of next, which is the period covered by the banks capital plans.
Federal Reserve System
-1
One possible reason Wells Fargo can distribute so much capital is that it needs less to finance new loans since the $T$ restrained its growth.
Federal Reserve System

The big payouts make the balance sheet cap imposed by the $T$ less painful for the shareholders. The limit on payouts carries a stigma, but it could have been worse. Morgan planned $6.8 billion distribution to shareholders after this stress test is close to what it planned after last Goldman Sachs planned payout for this year, $6.3 billion, is lower than last request of around $9.9 billion. But important to note that Goldman has only paid out roughly $5.7 billion of last sum.
Federal Reserve System

One reason the $T$ did not object to the two firms capital plans is that, although their payouts would have taken their capital below minimum requirements in the stress tests, there were mitigating circumstances. The two banks results were negatively affected by the recent tax bill enacted by Congress. Adapting to the new law, which meant doing things like repatriating money from abroad, caused losses at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs that depleted their capital going into the stress tests.

Altogether, the motivation for developing Kelsen is to provide the modularity and fun of Lego bricks to build digital governance systems, with the incorruptibility of $T$ software. Transparency, incorruptibility and modularity are the three core features of this framework, achieved through one very simple design this standard design makes the governance of any piece of public information legal documents, smart contracts or any type of public data transparent and easy. They can be used to govern all sorts of things products, services, or even entire organisations. see how it works Hans Kelsen was an Austrian constitutional law researcher. He coined the cornerstone concept of hierarchy of considered one of the most fundamental concepts in legal studies. He is the author of the Pure Theory of Law (1934), and helped establish the first Constitutional court, in 1920 in Austria.

A standard design for building governance systems At its core, Kelsen is a very simple design pattern for building governance systems on $T$ According to this design, Kelsen systems contain only two types of things organs and procedures. Organs are answers to a very simple question who can do what Kelsen systems use organs to store the result of governance processes. They are smart contracts that store user permissions and a registry of entries the files and documents to which governance applies, and who can modify them.

As generic as we built an organ, it can list dapp contracts that your system will be authorized to use, external service providers, members, voters, IPFS links, or even the $T$ list of your favorite cryptokitties. You can see it this way organs list what the governance will be about, leaving to procedures the question of how it is governed. Then, admins are people or smart contracts authorized to add or remove entries to an organ.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development $T$ promotes green economies in all the regions where it invests. Since 2004, it has developed strong cooperation with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) which has provided grants worth US$ 135 million for co-financing, technical cooperation and concessional finance to help the Bank address climate change and environmental degradation.

With the support of the GEF for projects ranging from renewable energy to energy efficiency and climate resilience, the $T$ is expected to invest up to US$ 1.5 billion to foster the transition to greener economies from Morocco to Mongolia, from Estonia to Egypt. To guarantee the longer term impact of its investments, the Bank also promotes strong policies for sustainable development, focuses on mobilising private sector finance and builds the local capacity of stakeholders such as regulators, corporate sector, municipalities to adopt environmentally sensible standards.

The range of $T$ projects supported by GEF includes many different types, from large to small. For example the FINTECC (Finance and Technology Transfer Centre for Climate Change) programme helps companies to adopt climate technologies. The implementation of such equipment results in saving energy, water and materials as well as in using renewable energy, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading to more climate resilience. In Tajikistan, X-Fit Premium gym in the capital Dushanbe saves energy and cuts costs thanks to a FINTECC investment into solar panels, LED lightings and efficient chillers. In total, the programme has already helped to save annual CO2 emissions of about 132,000 tonnes, equivalent to taking 28,000 cars off the road.

Farmer distress has become a focal political issue over the last two years with a string of often violent agitations rocking western and northern India, causing great discomfort to the ruling alliance. However, with its defeat in the elections to the three Hindi heartland states coming on top of the losses in rural Gujarat a year back, the BJP is on a notice that its promise to double farm income is seen largely as a chimera and it needs to prove its bonafides to the rural voters.

Investors in $T$ and across the world are betting that newly minted President Jair Bolsonaro will push through key changes to the social security system in Latin America's largest economy.

Beleaguered diamond miner $T$ Diamonds found a huge stone at its Cullinan mine in South Africa, where the biggest-ever diamond was found more than a century ago.

$T$ said Friday it recovered a 425-carat white color Type II stone. It's a welcome find for the company which has been weighed down by too much debt and growing concerns that it wasn't finding enough expensive stones. Just a handful of big finds can change the economics of some gem mines. The company's iconic Cullinan mine, once called the Premier Mine, has been operating since 1902 after a brickwork owner discovered diamonds on a farmer's land outside of Johannesburg. Just three years later, the 3 106-carat Cullinan diamond was dug from the new mine. It was cut into several polished gems, the two largest of which - the Great Star of Africa and the Lesser Star of Africa - are set in the Crown Jewels of Britain. Today's discovery sent the shares up as much as rebounding from a 16-year low. In the second half of last year, prices achieved at Cullinan slumped 31 from a year earlier to just $96 a carat, casting doubt on its ability to find big stones despite racking up millions in debt upgrading the mine.

$T$ has also been caught up in a wider industry downturn. Equities have tumbled amid a slump in prices for cheaper stones, hit hard by too much supply and feeble demand.

$T$ found a 100-carat white diamond and a 6.1-carat blue diamond earlier this year, but those failed to address its share slide. The 425-carat diamond is probably the sixth-biggest stone ever found at the mine and among the 15 largest found this century. While the stone will need to be analysed to figure the size of the polished stones it can yield - and therefore how much it's worth - there have been some early estimates. BMO Capital Markets said it could be worth more .

The company's iconic Cullinan mine, once called the Premier Mine, has been operating since 1902 after a brickwork owner discovered diamonds on a farmer's land outside of Johannesburg. Just three years later, the 3 106-carat Cullinan diamond was dug from the new mine.

With silver falling to nearly a $T$ low relative to gold in Q4, the miners latest results were naturally on the weaker side. The major silver miners have rallied higher on balance in recent months, enjoying a young upleg. a welcome change after they suffered a miserable 2018. Times are tough for silver miners, since prices have languished near extreme lows relative to gold. That has forced many traditional silver miners to increasingly diversify into gold. The major silver miners recently-released results illuminate their struggles. Four times a year publicly-traded companies release treasure troves of valuable information in the form of quarterly reports. Required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, these 10-Qs and 10-Ks contain the best fundamental data available to traders. They dispel all the sentiment distortions inevitably surrounding prevailing stock-price levels, revealing corporations underlying hard fundamental realities.

While 10-Qs with filing deadlines of 40 days after $T$ are required for normal quarters, 10-K annual reports are instead mandated after quarters ending fiscal years. Most silver miners logically run their accounting on calendar years, so they issue 10-Ks after Q4s.

Since these annual reports are larger and must be audited by independent CPAs, their filing deadlines are extended to 60 days after $T$ The definitive list of major silver-mining stocks to analyze comes from the most-popular silver-stock investment vehicle, the SIL Global X Silver Miners ETF ( SIL ).

Every $T$ I dive into the latest operating and financial results from top 17 companies. simply an arbitrary number that fits neatly into the table below, but still a commanding sample. As of mid-March these major silver miners accounted for fully 97.7 of total weighting. In they collectively mined 75.5m ounces of silver. The latest comprehensive data available for global silver supply and demand came from the Silver Institute in April 2018. That covered 2017, when world silver mine production totaled 852.1m ounces.

That equates to a run rate around 213.0m ounces per $T$ Assuming that mining pace persisted to top 17 silver miners were responsible for about 35 of world production. relatively high considering just 28 of global silver output came from primary silver mines 36 came from mines, 23 from copper, and 12 from gold. of all silver produced is merely an other-metals-mining byproduct. Primary silver mines and miners are fairly rare. Scarce silver-heavy deposits are required to support primary silver mines, where over half their revenue comes from silver. They are increasingly difficult to discover and ever-more expensive to develop. And challenging economics of recent years argue against miners even pursuing it. So even traditional major silver miners have shifted their investment focus into actively diversifying into far-more-profitable gold. Silver price levels are best measured relative to prevailing gold prices, which overwhelmingly drive silver price action.

It is expected that the project will provide clean, renewable solar power to offset the needs of approximately 2,800 local residents. The project was financed by a leading Japanese renewables finance bank and funded using committed pool of capital for Japanese FIT projects. The company has acquired over 350 MWs of projects since it entered the Japanese market in 2014 and continues to actively invest in high-quality projects in Japan. GSSG expects to have 200 MWs of projects under construction by the end of 2019. A subsidiary of GSSG will provide asset management services over the life of the Project.

- $T$ The C-J Monte Carlo Simulation Model C-J is a Monte Carlo simulation model used to assess risk in the 500. Traditional stock market models suffer from a number of problems including fat tails, serial correlation, and the failure to account for volatility clustering. The fat-tail problem arises because traditional finance theory uses the normal distribution. For investors, the practical implication of using such an approach is that traditional portfolio theory underestimates (and in some cases significantly underestimates) downside risk in the market. C-J uses data on valuation, earnings, and short-term historical patterns in the stock to correct for the problems noted above. C-J does this by using a series of non-normal conditional distributions.

Dealers import automobiles in $T$ by filing a bill of entry at customs, either for home consumption or under import for re-export. For automobiles imported for re-export, payment of customs duty is deferred under suspension for up to six months. For automobiles that are imported but not re-exported and are rather sold in the country, the timing of disclosure of VAT under reverse charge in their VAT returns is important.

Since the import values are automatically recorded in the Federal Tax Authority's (FTA) portal, dealers should be sure as to whether any adjustments should be made for every month in which the automobiles are sold in $T$ or whether the import VAT should only be reflected after six months, when the deferred period of customs has expired.

$T$ formally unveiled its highly-anticipated digital currency project called Libra.
Facebook
0
(CNN) - In its effort to bring the Libra cryptocurrency to life, perhaps the biggest hurdle for $T$ is a lack of trust and opposition from regulators around the world, who are concerned about Libra's potential implications for privacy and financial stability and $T$ role in managing it.
Facebook
-1
$T$ answer to those criticisms is the Libra Association, a group the company says is an independent, Switzerland-based organization that will govern the digital currency.
Facebook

The organization is a coalition of companies and nonprofits and is designed as a sort of buffer between $T$ and the project it developed.
Facebook

$T$ says it will ensure neither it nor any other company has an outsized influence over the new currency. The group has 28 founding member organizations but plans to grow to 100.
Facebook

But many of those founding members have close personal, professional and financial ties to $T$ and one another, calling $T$ characterization of the Association into question. Those links reach the group's top leadership.
Facebook

Experts say the connections raise questions about $T$ ongoing influence over the project and whose values will be applied to Libra.

When the white paper said $T$ will be just one of 100 members, you can see with your own eyes that's not quite true, said Katharina Pistor, a professor at Columbia Law School and an expert on corporate governance and finance. This is important because of what Libra aims to be and the responsibilities the Association would have, duties previously held mostly by governments and central banks.

Future Prospects While it remains to be seen how such a legally-binding $T$ will affect the development of the technology, many societal actors have come around to the mounting evidence that the negative impacts of AI require special attention. One big question that remains is whether businesses will be technically able to comply with requirements like explainability without losing the algorithm's accuracy and efficiency. As already mentioned, the AI landscape is dominated by algorithms that are chosen solely by its prediction accuracy. Oftentimes, these algorithms are so complex that humans do not understand why a particular prediction was made. Although there are some tools available that can be applied to explain the output of these so-called black box they, nevertheless, either reduce accuracy or provide only a rough approximation on how the prediction was made. In any case, it seems that this is still a far cry from the EU's goal to ensure the goodness of AI while also promoting its efficient use.

Investment Thesis With comparable sales stagnating in 2017, Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. ( DNKN ) unveiled a three-year plan for recovery. A menu simplification drive and new restaurant concepts rolled out, but sales failed to recover. A rebranding initiative followed with a new beverage-led focus to strategy.

While the asset-light company focuses on menu innovation, improved unit economics in an under-penetrated domestic market will drive franchisee-led expansion. The seasoned senior leadership is capable of advancing the well-established rebranding exercise despite the recent exit of the marketing head.

Credited with shaping the new rebranding initiative and the relaunch of espresso, his void has left the company actively seeking a replacement currently.

However, its LTM operating cash flow continues to grow at a faster clip reaching 6 YoY compared to 5 YoY growth of SBUX (adjusted for $7B worth of deferred revenue the SBUX recognized in FY18). With no sizeable debt repayments due in the short term, the superior operating cash flow generation and low capex requirement of the asset-light model should calm liquidity concerns.

The premium-priced $T$ line relaunched in November 2018 should sustain the ticket growth further. Its sales climbed more than 40 YoY in Q3 2019 from 35 YoY from a year ago to make up 10 of total sales, up from 8 in Q1 2019. We further expect the Go2s value platform to drive traffic while up-selling should lift. Highlighting its importance, when the company discontinued the campaign in Q3 2018, U.S. Dunkin' comps dipped to zero in the following quarter, compelling its resumption in Q1 2019. Peer-leading Margins As per SEC filings, DNKN's margins are superior to those of peers , even though its LTM operating margins have come down to 31 from in 2012-2015. In comparison, SBUX reported 15 of operating margin for FY19. We believe further catalysts to margins are ahead due to changes in the sales mix and asset-light operating model.

Stagnant Sales Growth Back in 2017, $T$ was at a crossroads. The company-wide comparable sales had declined to 3 YoY (year-over-year) from 5 YoY in 2012.
Dunkin'

$T$ a brand then-synonymous with fast high-carb and sugary foods, but generating an average of 78 of the total revenue over the period, was facing an uncertain future as healthy eating habits were getting popular among the U.S. diners who accounted for 82 of the company revenue.

To resurrect the stagnant sales, the company announced a three-year plan aiming at 1K of net new stores and low to mid-single digits of comparable sales growth for U.S. operations of $T$ in addition to a long-term overall growth target of 3 for the company by 2020. Source 2018 Investor Analyst Day Rebranding and the Strategic Shift Despite a new store design approach and menu simplification initiative launched in the first quarter of 2018 (Q1 2018), the lackluster sales performance continued at the leading QSR chain for donut and bagel, with its U.S. comps growth remaining sub -1 YoY in 2018 . The impact pressured DNKN's bottom-line as the margins from the donuts segment ranged over the years, dwarfing from Baskin-Robbins, its other QSR concept selling hard-serve ice-cream.

Revenue Growth Exceeds Target DNKN's LTM (last-twelve-month) revenue has expanded by 4 YoY on average in the past four quarters, in line with the long-term vision set in 2017 even though $T$ U.S. comps are yet to reach the target growing only 1 YoY on average during the period. However, Starbucks is well ahead with a 5 YoY increase in U.S. comps and 7 YoY growth in the top-line for the recently concluded 2019 financial year (FY19). The latter is fast widening its already expansive global footprint, growing the outlets by 7 YoY in FY19.

The newly-designed locations are equipped with high-tech coffee machinery and a dedicated $T$ order pick-up area. The well-trained staff supported by menu simplification speed up the service, a key theme of the new strategy. As franchisees adopt the new design concept spread across 900 locations as of October 2019 compared to 200 as of 2018 year-end, the repeat visits and more sales will follow shorter waiting times.

While $T$ implemented the Agenda 2010 in 2003 - a plan that reduced welfare benefits, regulations, taxes, and the deficit - Italy increased its debt and has not meaningfully changed policies. Today, the share of average wages collected by the Italian government via income and social security taxes is among the highest in the OECD at 48 percent. In addition, the country imposes a value-added tax of 22 percent on most goods and services, one of the highest in Europe. Plus, Italy's corporate, capital gains, gift, and myriad other taxes are passed on to individuals and borne directly by workers. These high taxes lead to a growing shadow economy, where people under-report work to avoid paying taxes. Many Italians save their income from tax collectors by illegally working in construction or services, transferring an apartment before the death of a relative, and hiding savings from the wealth tax in Swiss bank accounts.

(Adds quotes, background)BERLIN, June 19 (Reuters) - $T$ Ifo institute on Tuesday cut its forecasts for growth in Europe's biggest economy this year and next, citing a weak start to the year and increased global risks. Ifo said it expected the German economy to grow by 1.8 percent this year and in 2019, a big revision downwards from previous forecasts of 2.6 percent and 2.1 percent respectively. The economy developed significantly more weakly than anticipated in the first few months of the year, Ifo economist Timo Wollmershaeuser said. The global economic risks have risen significantly, he added.

Short-term snapshot The $T$ report said that, consistent with the expectations of improved trade volumes, almost 70 of Egyptian companies (above the global average of expect to increase their demand for trade financing in the coming 12 months. Moreover, 61 of respondents expect accessing finance to become easier in the year ahead, after the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) removed the last currency controls in November 2017. That alleviated the risk that foreign firms would not be able to repatriate profits.

That said, $T$ noted that some barriers to trade finance do persist. Although the currency has been stable for almost a year, the potential for volatility is sometimes flagged as a concern, given the move to a floating currency. While availability of US dollar finance has improved, high transaction costs remain a cause for concern for firms, it added.

$T$ pointed out that almost two-thirds of Egyptian businesses expect higher volumes of trade in services over the coming year, with tourism and transport services to remain key sectoral strengths. The two sectors accounted for some 80 of total services exports in 2016. Tourism arrivals have picked up, supported by improved social and political stability. Arrivals rose over 54 in the first 10 months of 2017 compared to a year earlier, though they remain down versus 2015 levels. Security remains the biggest risk to further recovery in the sector. Meanwhile, Suez Canal shipping volumes and revenues will gain from rising global commerce.

devaluation of the Egyptian $T$ have fueled optimism among Egyptian businesses. Firms also expect the broad economic reform programme to aid the short- and long-term outlooks for trade. Middle Eastern countries, specifically Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, along with the US and UK, will remain top trade partners, but trade links with Asian economies will increasingly gain importance. The impact of economic reforms on the economy and business environment According to the report, the key turning point economy in recent years was the liberalisation of the exchange rate in November 2016, which ended the acute FX shortage and helped restore confidence in the local economy.

New $T$ is already rich with subsea capacity, and as the other transatlantic systems start reaching their 20-year life cycle, the HAVFRUE design will start to make the economics of the other cables unviable. In just two decades, advances in subsea cable construction have resulted in HAVFRUE's ability to deliver superior speed and lower latency design. NJFX has also collaborated with carriers to install diverse fiber to its campus supporting carrier diversity across North America with carriers such as Altice, Crown Castle Fiber, Epsilon, Windstream, Zayo and Zenfi.

The idea that austerity swayed voters for Brexit is based on a paper by Thiemo Fetzer, an $T$ of economics at the University of Warwick. His paper claims to show that the welfare cuts under David coalition government of 2010-15 had a decisive impact on the decision to leave the EU. Fetzer argues that material economic changes encouraged grievances with the political system and that this led many to support first Ukip and then Brexit. By his calculations, austerity was responsible for as much as a 10 percentage point .

Laffer said Friday that the reduced $T$ receipts were to be expected initially, but that the increased economic growth will offset those losses in due time. It takes a while for that growth to compound and really make a difference in tax revenues, but it will happen, he said. When that does happen and remember going to happen with payroll taxes, property taxes, income taxes, all the other taxes be in great shape from this tax cut and we should go even further. Laffer said he supported the idea of further cutting rates on capital gains, or investor profits from sales of stocks and other financial securities. President Trump has said he expects his tax cuts and deregulation agenda will spur 3 economic growth for multiple years a claim almost universally panned by economists but Laffer thinks it could be even higher.

His death was announced by Nuffield College of the University of Oxford, where he was a longtime professor. The cause was a brain tumor, the London Times reported. Dr. Mirrlees, who shared the 1996 Nobel Prize with William Vickrey of Columbia University, approached economics from a background in mathematics. He was particularly fascinated by ideas first put forth by Vickrey and others concerning information asymmetry, in which one party in an economic transaction is privy to knowledge the other does not have.

This is also equivalent to buying when the daily return is positive or when price is higher than its two-day moving average and selling when the reverse occurs, as stated below Buy Pt -1 0 Sell Pt -1 0 It may be seen that Sharpe for the trivial $T$ is 1.95 versus 0.60 for buy and hold in the 40 year period consider.

Annualized return for the trivial $T$ is 18.16 versus 8.32 for buying buy and hold. The steady growth in log scale corresponds to exponential growth in linear scale as shown below The risk-adjusted return as measured by MAR is 1.70 versus 0.17 for buy and hold.

Below are few comments Obviously in real world the $T$ would incur transaction cost. The trading frequency is about one trade per week but the important consideration is that before 1993, when the SPY ETF was launched, it was possible to trade the index only via the use of a tracking portfolio that would reduce transaction cost due to a smaller number of securities. Despite the transaction cost issue, the point is that a trivial forecast based on the last two traded daily prices consistently outperformed buy and hold on both absolute and risk-adjusted basis. As I have shown in a paper, all moving averages with a period ranging from 2 to 20 outperformed buy and hold before commission in the period considered.
strategy

For example, a 10 day moving average would have resulted in a frequency of about one trade per month, making this a more viable $T$ under transaction costs.

The above result contradicts directly EMH since the simplicity of the $T$ alludes to a structural dynamic in the period considered that allowed market timing and potential consistent outperformance of the market. I argued in the M4 Conference that the cause of this dynamic distortion was reflexivity forecasts for higher prices resulted in higher prices and in turn higher prices results in forecasts for higher prices. This dynamic persisted until the trade became unsustainable due to liquidity constraints among other things.

The chart below shows what happened to this trivial $T$ after 1999 The $T$ stopped working suddenly in 2000 but has regained some momentum after central bank intervention in 2009. The chart below the equity curve shows the 1-lag, 252-day autocorrelation of daily returns of 500. It may be seen that the autocorrelation was high in the 60s and 70s and then started decaying.

By late 90s, the autocorrelation became negative and this was the reason this trivial $T$ described above stopped working as the market became primarily mean-reverting.

There are some hypotheses about the cause of the high autocorrelation in the 60s and 70s that basically fueled the momentum of the trivial $T$ George Soros has mentioned the rally in conglomerates but a simpler explanation is that the high autocorrelation was a random outcome that nevertheless persisted due to reflexivity and until arbitrage removed it from the market.

VERONA, Italy (AP) $T$ the city of Romeo and Juliet was the backdrop for a culture clash Saturday, as it hosted both a conservative congress. on family values and a march by civic groups who denounced the event as a movement to limit LGBT and women's rights. The World Congress of Families, which runs through Sunday, revealed yet another rift in Italy's governing coalition, as well as providing a platform for right-wing extremists seeking to reopen the debate over abortion, which was legalized in Italy in 1978.

Italy's far-right Forza Nuova party, while not an official participant at the congress, used the congress as a backdrop to announce plans to seek a referendum to make abortion illegal. Two previous efforts decades ago failed. Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, a featured speaker Saturday at the congress, said legalized abortion and divorce were not up for revision by Italy's populist government.

$T$ said Friday it recovered a 425-carat white color Type II stone. It's a welcome find for the company which has been weighed down by too much debt and growing concerns that it wasn't finding enough expensive stones. Just a handful of big finds can change the economics of some gem mines. The company's iconic Cullinan mine, once called the Premier Mine, has been operating since 1902 after a brickwork owner discovered diamonds on a farmer's land outside of Johannesburg. Just three years later, the 3 106-carat Cullinan diamond was dug from the new mine. It was cut into several polished gems, the two largest of which - the Great Star of Africa and the Lesser Star of Africa - are set in the Crown Jewels of Britain. Today's discovery sent the shares up as much as rebounding from a 16-year low. In the second half of last year, prices achieved at Cullinan slumped 31 from a year earlier to just $96 a carat, casting doubt on its ability to find big stones despite racking up millions in debt upgrading the mine.

$T$ has also been caught up in a wider industry downturn. Equities have tumbled amid a slump in prices for cheaper stones, hit hard by too much supply and feeble demand.

$T$ found a 100-carat white diamond and a 6.1-carat blue diamond earlier this year, but those failed to address its share slide.

While the stone will need to be analysed to figure the size of the polished stones it can yield - and therefore how much it's worth - there have been some early estimates. BMO Capital Markets said it could be worth more .

With silver falling to nearly a $T$ low relative to gold in Q4, the miners latest results were naturally on the weaker side. The major silver miners have rallied higher on balance in recent months, enjoying a young upleg. a welcome change after they suffered a miserable 2018. Times are tough for silver miners, since prices have languished near extreme lows relative to gold. That has forced many traditional silver miners to increasingly diversify into gold. The major silver miners recently-released results illuminate their struggles. Four times a year publicly-traded companies release treasure troves of valuable information in the form of quarterly reports. Required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, these 10-Qs and 10-Ks contain the best fundamental data available to traders. They dispel all the sentiment distortions inevitably surrounding prevailing stock-price levels, revealing corporations underlying hard fundamental realities.

While 10-Qs with filing deadlines of 40 days after $T$ are required for normal quarters, 10-K annual reports are instead mandated after quarters ending fiscal years. Most silver miners logically run their accounting on calendar years, so they issue 10-Ks after Q4s.

Since these annual reports are larger and must be audited by independent CPAs, their filing deadlines are extended to 60 days after $T$ The definitive list of major silver-mining stocks to analyze comes from the most-popular silver-stock investment vehicle, the SIL Global X Silver Miners ETF ( SIL ). Launched way back in April 2010, it has maintained a big first-mover advantage. net assets were running $362m in mid-March near the end of earnings season, 6.1x greater than its next-biggest SIL is the leading silver-stock benchmark.

Every $T$ I dive into the latest operating and financial results from top 17 companies. simply an arbitrary number that fits neatly into the table below, but still a commanding sample. As of mid-March these major silver miners accounted for fully 97.7 of total weighting. In they collectively mined 75.5m ounces of silver. The latest comprehensive data available for global silver supply and demand came from the Silver Institute in April 2018. That covered 2017, when world silver mine production totaled 852.1m ounces.
quarter

That equates to a run rate around 213.0m ounces per $T$ Assuming that mining pace persisted to top 17 silver miners were responsible for about 35 of world production. relatively high considering just 28 of global silver output came from primary silver mines 36 came from mines, 23 from copper, and 12 from gold. of all silver produced is merely an other-metals-mining byproduct. Primary silver mines and miners are fairly rare. Scarce silver-heavy deposits are required to support primary silver mines, where over half their revenue comes from silver. They are increasingly difficult to discover and ever-more expensive to develop. And challenging economics of recent years argue against miners even pursuing it. So even traditional major silver miners have shifted their investment focus into actively diversifying into far-more-profitable gold. Silver price levels are best measured relative to prevailing gold prices, which overwhelmingly drive silver price action.

Amid high demand, there is a need for infrastructure that can allow for the movement of more oil. The proposed Liberty Pipeline, which will provide opportunity to shippers to secure transportation service from the Bakken production areas to Corpus Christi, TX, and almost doubling the capacity of the Dakota Access Pipeline to 1.1 million barrels per day, are touted as solutions. While the $1.6 billion Liberty pipeline will have an initial throughput capacity of 350,000 barrels per day and is expected to start operations in another two years, Energy Transfer has launched an open season to test volume commitments for the Dakota Access Pipeline expansion.

Regardless of whether it is an antenna addition or a completely new $T$ there are zoning and planning processes, which are rarely quick and can take up to two years in some jurisdictions. In the competitive business landscape of the wireless industry, it's important to optimize CAPEX spend and thoughtfully choose how networks are sized to meet traffic growth which shows little sign of slowing down. Operators must decide whether software densification tools or physical network densification is the right approach for them. At the end of the day, the most important factors include how much you're willing to spend and how quickly you need to deliver increased capacity to your existing 3G, 4G and future 5G networks.

Machine learning $T$ densification is about efficiency in terms of network performance and operator financials. These modern machine learning tools can quickly offer significant capacity increases at a fraction of the cost of simply building bigger networks. Through their deployment, operators can improve customer experience overnight, permanently reduce capacity-driven CAPEX costs on 3G, 4G and 5G networks and, as a direct result of reducing costs, improve their financial operating performance. Future wireless networks will be blended networks, making use of 3G, 4G and 5G radio access technologies. Operators will deploy 5G in areas where they can make a business case with positive ROI, and where the economics are more challenging, 3G and 4G networks will need to be supported as traffic continues to grow.

However, the current $T$ PE trades at a discount compared to that in 2017. Therefore, a premium reflecting the catalysts to sales and margins is appropriate. Investment Thesis With comparable sales stagnating in 2017, Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. ( DNKN ) unveiled a three-year plan for recovery. A menu simplification drive and new restaurant concepts rolled out, but sales failed to recover. A rebranding initiative followed with a new beverage-led focus to strategy. The flexible branding makes up for the fast-moving consumer choices, though it plunges the company headlong into coffee wars' against the leading peers such as Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX ).

However, the stock continues to underperform, and its $T$ PE has not yet reached the level in 2017. The revenue growth already outpaces the long-term target, and the margins stand above peers, pointing to an undervalued stock. While the asset-light company focuses on menu innovation, improved unit economics in an under-penetrated domestic market will drive franchisee-led expansion. The seasoned senior leadership is capable of advancing the well-established rebranding exercise despite the recent exit of the marketing head.

The premium-priced $T$ line relaunched in November 2018 should sustain the ticket growth further. Its sales climbed more than 40 YoY in Q3 2019 from 35 YoY from a year ago to make up 10 of total sales, up from 8 in Q1 2019. We further expect the Go2s value platform to drive traffic while up-selling should lift. Highlighting its importance, when the company discontinued the campaign in Q3 2018, U.S. Dunkin' comps dipped to zero in the following quarter, compelling its resumption in Q1 2019. Peer-leading Margins As per SEC filings, DNKN's margins are superior to those of peers , even though its LTM operating margins have come down to 31 from in 2012-2015. In comparison, SBUX reported 15 of operating margin for FY19. We believe further catalysts to margins are ahead due to changes in the sales mix and asset-light operating model.

A new beverage-focused strategy was announced by the management in September 2018 , changing the brand previously known as $T$ to simply Dunkin'. The new mission identified as serving great coffee fast' officially launched in January 2019, pitting the company against well-established players in the industry such as Starbucks and McDonald's Corporation ( MCD ). Since its launch, the stock, however, remains largely unchanged in value, compared to 55 and 18 gains of Starbucks and McDonald's, respectively. The underperformance suggests a mispriced stock, notwithstanding the upside catalysts from the newly laid-out strategy.

Revenue Growth Exceeds Target DNKN's LTM (last-twelve-month) revenue has expanded by 4 YoY on average in the past four quarters, in line with the long-term vision set in 2017 even though $T$ U.S. comps are yet to reach the target growing only 1 YoY on average during the period. However, Starbucks is well ahead with a 5 YoY increase in U.S. comps and 7 YoY growth in the top-line for the recently concluded 2019 financial year (FY19). The latter is fast widening its already expansive global footprint, growing the outlets by 7 YoY in FY19.

The newly-designed locations are equipped with high-tech coffee machinery and a dedicated $T$ order pick-up area. The well-trained staff supported by menu simplification speed up the service, a key theme of the new strategy. As franchisees adopt the new design concept spread across 900 locations as of October 2019 compared to 200 as of 2018 year-end, the repeat visits and more sales will follow shorter waiting times.

There is also mounting evidence suggesting $T$ and mortar retail is more profitable than online. In-store purchase has the highest profit margin followed by BOPIS (buy online pick up in store). I highly doubt retailers will give up their 2 most profitable sales channels.

Online profit margins are further eroded by the fact that return rates are substantially higher in e-commerce than through $T$ and mortar. Brick and mortar sales are being increasingly under-reported as BOPIS is recorded as an online sale despite being inextricably linked to the physical location. If one buys a garment online and returns it in store, it is sometimes recorded as a positive sale online and a negative sale in store.

We understand that the company has many proposals for investigator initiated trials $T$ which can provide opportunities for future data catalysts and the ability to expand the use of Dextenza. Lastly, the company's technology platform has given rise to several product candidates and the company remains active in advancing such technologies and products for out-licensing opportunities. These opportunities, including the company's ongoing partnership with Regeneron ( REGN ), have potential for upside surprise and may give rise to non-dilutive funding opportunities for the company. We believe that announcements on these programs advancing or becoming the subject of a license or partnership arrangement represent upside to current expectations.

Launch off to a good start - New $T$ J-Code expected to accelerate adoption The Dextenza launch is still in early days, but we learned that feedback from both physicians and patients is positive. In 3Q, the company was focused on fine-tuning the positioning of Dextenza in the market, helping physicians trial the product in their practice and importantly, helping them figure out reimbursement. We continue to believe that physician economics is critical for a product like Dextenza to achieve strong sales, and as a buy and bill therapy, reliable and consistent reimbursement for physicians must be in place. With that said, the company and physicians have begun to better manage the reimbursement cycle, and as physicians gain experience, they are seeing much shorter reimbursement times, versus when they first used the product.

With the $T$ J-Code for Dextenza becoming effective on October 1st, solidifying payment if properly billed, adoption of the product is expected to accelerate.

Cohen said problematic products made from EPS include fast $T$ containers, disposable cups and packaging trays that hold meat, fruit and vegetables. Many Durbanites are unaware of the impact of EPS and enjoy the material because it is cheap, light, insulating and disposable. However, it has a dark side. Because it is so light, easily fragments, and is most often used outdoors, it gets into the environment easily and is one of most mismanaged items of waste in the city, and indeed globally, he said. EPS is almost impossible to clean up once in the environment. Ask the army of municipal beach cleaners and folk at cleanbluelagoon, who battle this scourge on an ongoing basis.

Mark Bowden Here's $T$ best tip for you today, is that in this virtual world, we're very, very close up to the camera. We're not seeing the whole of the body like we would more in real life as somebody approaches us. We're pretty much getting people's faces immediately, so eye contact becomes really important and height dominance becomes really important as well. Two really simple things you can do. Raise up your laptop camera. I've got mine at the moment on this recycle bin here.

If I don't have it there, you will notice that you end up just looking up $T$ nose all the time and I have height dominance over you. This probably doesn't feel like such a good communication, but if I pop it on the bin like so, adjust the camera, now you've got the right eye line.

So move the camera up to the eye line, grab that eye contact of the camera and your audience by putting a smiley Post-it note just above it. That'll keep you optimistic and engaged with the audience.

It's from the Rockefeller Institute's Liz Farmer, published nationally and in Crain's Chicago Business That idea is for state and local $T$ to issue bonds to borrow money for pensions. They are called pension obligation bonds, or POBs, which we have criticized repeatedly at Wirepoints. And the proposal is to make those bonds tax-exempt, meaning federal taxpayers would subsidize them. First, POBs are inherently foolish. They represent nothing more than borrowing to cover debt one credit card to another replacing unfunded pension debt with unfunded bond debt. They are a can-kicking at its purest. Worse, they gamble that interest paid on the bond will be less than earnings made on the stocks a pension would buy with the borrowed money.

The grouping, named VentilatorChallengeUK , was formed recently in response to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's calls for the country's businesses to step in and help meet rising demand for life-saving equipment. In contrast to the U.S., where President Donald Trump on Friday officially invoked the Defense Production Act to force General Motors to manufacture thousands of ventilators, most of the projects involving the aerospace sector in Europe are born from the industry's own initiatives.

The $T$ regulator has been involved throughout and is expected to quickly sign off on an agreed new design after the final audit, according to VentilatorChallengeUK The consortium is now working to start production of this design, which is based on existing technologies and can be assembled from materials and parts in current production.

In parallel, the group will provide another producer of $T$ ventilators with additional manufacturing support and assembly facilities in order to scale up production of a second existing ventilator design which has full regulatory approval. PROMOTED GKN, whose technologies are used in business jets, single-aisle and widebody aircraft and fifth-generation fighter aircraft, will establish a new assembly plant and Rolls-Royce will set up a supply chain to feed in materials as quickly as possible. The engine maker's team dedicated to the ventilator project includes controls, valve and pump specialists who normally work in its Controls business in Solihull, near Birmingham, and commercial, procurement and programme management specialists usually based in its Derby campus. Rolls-Royce said is expects the team to grow significantly in the coming days and are also using resources in the U.S., so that we can work around the clock.

The retrofit was prompted by a request from the European Commission for assistance in the production of urgently needed $T$ equipment, specifically the production of protective masks and valves for respirators using 3D printing. DLR said is currently assessing its 3D printer capabilities, noting that the performance varies depending on the type of printer. Its most powerful printers can produce up to 10 protective masks or 15 valves for ventilators per day but by networking institutes and facilities, it will be possible to produce larger quantities.

By Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) - The United States has given banks a two-year break from provisions for loans soured by the $T$ pandemic, seeking to keep credit flowing while borrowers struggle to stay afloat as economic activity grinds to a halt. Europe, meanwhile, is taking a less accommodating stance as the authorities on opposite sides of the Atlantic follow different paths, in contrast with the close global cooperation aimed at rebuilding resilience in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago.

The following explains the rules banks are governed by when it comes to accounting for losses and how they are being amended temporarily to ride out the $T$ crisis. HOW DID WE GET HERE In the run up to the financial crisis banks did not provision for loans until a repayment was missed or a borrower defaulted - far too late to raise capital in market meltdowns. Taxpayers ended up bailing out lenders, prompting world leaders to call for reforms that require banks to provision for potential losses when a loan is first made, long before any problems emerge.

The IASB, regulators and central banks in Europe have so far stuck with the IFRS 9 rule and merely asked banks to be flexible when $T$ comes to calculating provisions. The financial shock from the pandemic should be viewed as temporary, they say, pointing to other measures being implemented. Regulators are granting loan repayment holidays and allowing banks to use some of their capital buffers, while governments are pumping billions of euros into economies and offering loan guarantees. This all cuts down on provisioning, European regulators have said, though IFRS 9 remains in force. European banking officials say the EU guidance on IFRS 9 remains conceptual while U.S. authorities have been blunter and more forceful.

Gross domestic product will decline by about 10 percent in the first three quarters of 2020 before a gradual recovery in the final three months, James McIntyre, $T$ economist at Bloomberg Economics, wrote in a research report Monday.
Australia

He expect $T$ to return to its pre-coronavirus level of activity for three years. The grim economic reality is that not all businesses and jobs will be able to be saved despite the best efforts of fiscal policy makers, McIntyre wrote. Fiscal measures are still essential, and worth it it is less expensive to assist firms and households through to an eventual recovery than to rebuild the economy after the fact. Prime Minister Scott Morrison pledged Monday to spend A$130 billion ($80 billion) over six months to try to safeguard jobs, in a third tranche of fiscal stimulus.

The Reserve Bank of $T$ has cut its cash rate to near-zero and is buying government bonds to lower yields and reduce interest rates across the economy.

Tens of thousands of Australian workers have already been sent home as retailers and airlines all-but close and queues outside job centers lengthen. The government has so far passed more than A$80 billion worth of fiscal support and announcement today brings total fiscal and monetary stimulus to A$320 billion, or 16.4 percent of GDP. The labor market dislocation will be substantial, and is likely to linger for an extended period, even though economic growth may bounce back, McIntyre wrote. Economies will have to run hot, or above potential for an extended period to not only re-engage unemployed .

In recent years, drone racing has become increasingly popular in $T$ (Hopes on drone-racing body to boost sport Jan 3, 2017). This has led to more individuals practising with drones in open fields and carparks. A number of these are in residential areas, where enthusiasts can be seen racing their drones next to high-rise buildings. Drones flying at high speeds generate significant levels of noise pollution, especially for people living on higher floors where the sound is amplified. According to a preliminary study by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, people find the noise of drones more irritating than that of ground vehicles, even at the same volume. Furthermore, these drones pose a risk to residents' privacy, given that they are able to fly up to 20 storeys high and have cameras installed on them, allowing for a first-person view into people's homes. Why are individuals allowed to fly their drones in residential areas with no limits to their speed or altitude .

James chose not to play at college and declared for the draft instead, and in 2003 the forward signed with the $T$ the local team for the Akron native. Soon after, he signed his first contract 3 years, $12.9 million, with an option for a 4 year. That option was exercised after just one season. A promising rookie year where he averaged nearly 21 points per game led to an even better second year where he made his first All-Star team.
Cleveland Cavaliers

On the final year, he averaged over 31 points per game and took the $T$ to the playoffs, breaking a 7-year playoff drought. For these efforts, James was rewarded in 2006 with a three-year contract extension worth $60 million. He rewarded the team in the 2006-07 season by nearly single-handedly bringing them to the NBA Finals, where they were swept by the Spurs.
Cleveland Cavaliers

The next three seasons with the $T$ saw playoff appearances - as well as his first two league MVPs - but James' frustration with the team's inability to win a championship grew as free agency loomed. In his first free agency, LeBron left Cleveland to join the Miami Heat - and was such a superstar that he did it in an infamous live televised event called The Decision.

It wasn't popular with fans, but LeBron's choice to do a sign-and-trade, where the $T$ traded him to the Heat for draft picks after signing him to a 6-year, $110 million contract, worked out. He went to win a championship, and those first four years with the Heat saw a Finals appearance every time - with two Finals victories. In those four years, LeBron also won two more MVPs and made the All-Star Game each year, and Spotrac estimates he made nearly $64 million in those seasons in salary. Still, in 2014 James decided to take advantage of the opt-out in his contract and become a free agent again.

It was the city of Cleveland's first since 1964. LeBron, unsurprisingly, was Finals MVP. His mission was accomplished, but he signed a 3-year, $100 million contract with Cleveland afterward. The team made the Finals the first two years of this contract, but saw a fall to the Warriors each time.

As $T$ ( $T$ ) ( FOXA ) continues to benefit from the incipient bidding war for the majority of its assets, I continue to regard NewFox, the company that will be left behind post-merger, as the potential hidden gem for $T$ shareholders. I am not alone in this view, but most commentary has focused on NewFox's cable operations, which will certainly represent the bulk of its revenue going forward, focusing on news and sports.

In a way, $T$ is where Netflix ( NFLX ) was in the early years of its streaming operation. It is staying in the same industry, but basically hitting reset on how it goes about providing consumers with content. And it is relying on third-party licensed content to fuel its offering. Some are sanguine about this others see the escalating costs licensing imposes and point out that Netflix itself is rapidly shifting to owning its own content, and question how viable the network is without the studio.

In baseball, the $T$ swing must match the path of the baseball thrown by the pitcher as closely as possible, and for as long as possible, to successfully hit the ball.
batter
1
To be successful, the $T$ must master two dimensions, horizontal and vertical. The zo aim of the pitch will affect the horizontal dimension while the speed of the pitch will affect the vertical dimension.
batter
1
The $T$ job is to time the arrival of the pitch based on the estimated speed of the ball while determining where, horizontally, it will cross the plate.
batter
0
The shape of the bat helps the $T$ in the horizontal space as its length compensates for more error, right to left.
batter
0
However, the narrow 2''-4'' barrel does not cover a lot of vertical ground, forcing the $T$ to be more accurate judging the vertical height of a pitch than the horizontal location. The key to success then, is to have a good swing that is repeatable and adjustable to the angle of the pitched ball.
batter
1
Since the pitcher is actually standing above the $T$ and is throwing the ball from above his shoulder, the ball will be traveling in a downward arcing flight to the strike zone. The optimum swing plane for the bat would be a slight upswing to closely match the angle of the ball as it travels into the strike zone.
batter
-1
The longer the $T$ is able to keep the bat on the same path as the baseball, the greater the chance of hitting the baseball. As mentioned earlier, developing the skills needed to hit a baseball even three out of ten at bats, can take many years of practice. In reality, most young players taking up the sport of baseball will not have long and lasting baseball careers. They start out playing on Little League teams while they are young, play in high school if they enjoy the sport and if they are very good, play in college. From there, only a select few will have a paying career in baseball. Therefore, young players have very few years in which to develop into good baseball players.
batter
-1
Accordingly, there exists a need for a device to include improved training features which addresses the training time and consistency of the $T$ swing. Ideally, the improvements would be implemented in an easy to use and inexpensive device that allows wide acceptance, especially in families with limited resources. In addition to the background information obtained for this patent application, VerticalNews journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent application Briefly and in general terms, the present disclosure is directed towards an athletic swing plane indicator. The disclosed athletic swing plane indicator easily attaches to a standard baseball bat and gives a visual indication of the swing plane for a baseball bat as it is being swung. Bright LEDs in the athletic swing plane indicator along with the speed of the bat's movement cause the persistence of vision effect in humans and yields a visible streak along the swing plane of the bat.

Just days before the expected reveal on October 2, a video surfaced online by c allegedly showing the unboxing and powering up the next generation of $T$ Pro, reportedly called the $T$ Pro 6. In the comments, however, we see viewers claiming that the product displayed in the video is a fake mostly due to the lack of USB-C port -- despite no predecessor having the feature either.

Nevertheless, the $T$ Pro 6 is shown to sport the same USB-A port as the previous models. As for the rest of the specs, Tech Radar notes that it appears to have 128GB of storage and 8GB of memory.

Apart from that, we know very little about the model except that aesthetically, it's quite similar to the latest $T$ Pro if the product in the video is proven to be authentic.

Australian $T$ has the chance to defend her K1 world title after qualifying for the final at the world championships in Rio de Janeiro. Fox is hoping to become the most successful slalom paddler in the history of the sport by winning another individual title this weekend. Fox was the last paddler on the course on Friday, and had to deal with rapidly fading light in Rio. It was a hard fight the whole way down and a lot of girls had trouble down near the finish, she said. So I really wanted to make sure I was getting all those gates all the way down, and getting the speed on the boat. I've got a few areas to fix up tomorrow. Fox was the only Australian to make it through to the final, with Kate Eckhardt finishing 28th, fading away after a strong start. In the men's C1 event, Daniel Watkins finished 22nd and Ian Borrows was 27th.

NAIROBI $T$ - Kenyan athletes who engage in doping do it in an uncoordinated, unsophisticated and opportunistic way, with no sign of an institutionalized system, according to a World Anti-Doping Agency report released on Thursday.

The doping practices of Kenyan athletes are unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated and there is no evidence of an institutionalized system, the report said. Doping in Kenya is drastically different from other doping structures discovered elsewhere in the world.

The $T$ were preparing to play their final game under Bowden, what turned out to be a 33-21 $T$ victory over West Virginia in the Gator Bowl to close out the 2009 season. The last game, right before I became a head coach, is one of the best memories ever had, Fisher recalled on Sunday, as his 8-4 Aggies prepared for their Gator Bowl collision with 9-3 North Carolina State on Monday night. We were in the locker room by ourselves about an hour before the game, along with our team chaplain, Clint Purvis, and we were having a historical talk about football. I mean, all the way back. a historian of the game, and Coach Bowden is a historian of the game. I remember sitting in this stadium and having that conversation with him, and it was just amazing. I could not have had the torch passed to me by any better guy in the world than Coach Bowden I just have some great memories here.

One of Texas coach Jimbo most poignant recollections of college football took place in the NFL home of the Jacksonville Jaguars, but not on the grass and between the lines. This moving moment for the memory book instead occurred in a stadium locker room, in a spontaneous sit down with the man he was about to replace at Florida State, the iconic Bobby Bowden. The Seminoles were preparing to play their final game under Bowden, what turned out to be a 33-21 FSU victory over West Virginia in the Gator Bowl to close out the 2009 season.

At the weekend they were also drawn against Tunisian side $T$ in the Caf Confederation Cup in a competition that also includes KCCA. Yet despite all those glowing statistics that saw Espinoza lose only thrice in 15 games overall and had a win percentage of 60 per cent, insiders at the club felt the team was in idle mode. Having been offered a two-year contract in August, main task was to guide the team to the much craved Caf Champions League group stages. But after scraping past Sudanese side Al Merreikh on away goals rule after a 2-2 aggregate draw, Vipers and Espinoza in particular were exposed by a tactically superior CS Constantine side to bow out of the Champions League, 3-0 on aggregate. The result and performance brought more scrutiny on Espinoza and his work methods. Daily Monitor understands that Espinoza, who had no knowledge of African football and came in on the strong recommendation of Mubarak Wamboya, was insecure with many of his players and staff at Kitende.

The $T$ management appears to be determined to destroy the newspaper. The latest is terminating local journalists and telling them that they can apply for their jobs with another company. The paper contains little local material now it is mostly from other newspapers. The delivery schedule is ridiculous and certainly did not save the paper money as claimed. The comics continue to be difficult to read in spite of suggested solutions. The paper has forgotten local sports, high school and college, as well.

LAUNCESTON, $T$ (AP) Cameron Bancroft was out for just two runs on his return to competitive cricket following a nine-month ban for his role in the $T$ test team's ball-tampering plot in South Africa in March.

Bancroft was selected by Perth Scorchers for the Big Bash League Twenty20 game against Hobart Hurricanes on Sunday after his suspension by Cricket $T$ ended. He came in with his team 16-3 and was greeted by a few boos. He was out caught behind soon after, facing just four deliveries including one wide to leave the Scorchers 19-4. He also kept wicket as his team went on to lose by six wickets. Bancroft was captured on television using a piece of sandpaper to rough up the ball during the third test in South Africa, and then trying to hide the sandpaper down his trousers when he realized he had been spotted. The scandal developed into a highly embarrassing episode for Australian cricket.

Test captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner were banned for 12 months for their parts in the plot, which resulted in a major shake-up at Cricket $T$ In an interview aired Wednesday, Bancroft claimed Warner pressured him to tamper with the ball. Smith also spoke publicly about the scandal recently and said he became aware of the plan by Warner and Bancroft to tamper but didn't do anything to stop it.

The historic victory was all the more credible as Thunder wide draw in stall 12 of 13 was seen as a potential hindrance against other leading lights such as $T$ and North America who had more favourable draws. But Soumillon was alert from the outset and soon was rid of any disadvantage by moving across and bagging a prominent position on the heels of leader North America. However it was clear from two furlongs out that the race would be between the front pair of Thunder Snow and Gronkowski and it was the former who just had the edge at the line.

First off, repeating as Stanley Cup champions. And if the Capitals are going to add a second Cup to their collection, they had better find a way to win at Tampa Bay's Amalie Arena.

$T$ (46-24-8, 100 points) squares off against the Lightning, winners of the Presidents' Cup, on Saturday in Tampa for their third and final meeting. Collecting 100 points for the fifth straight season, the Capitals hold a three-point lead over the New York Islanders for the top spot in the Metropolitan Division with four games to play, but solving the Lightning has been an issue in the two previous matchups. The Eastern Conference powerhouses will face each other for the third time this month, but the Capitals (0-1-1) are looking for their first win against Tampa Bay.

$T$ has won three straight -- two over Carolina in a home-and-home set -- and is 3-1-0 in its last four games since falling in overtime at home to Tampa Bay. Goaltender Braden Holtby, who notched a 30-win campaign for the fifth consecutive season, said his team should never assume it will get into the postseason, regardless of the standings. The more you play, the more you realize seeding doesn't matter, said Holtby. Your goal is to make the playoffs. We're supposed to make the playoffs. Maybe we take it a bit for granted. We've been lucky to have good teams. However, no one this season has been close to the Lightning (59-14-4), especially on home ice. Tampa Bay sports a 32-6-2 mark at home, and with nothing at stake in the standings in terms .

It doesn't seem right to me, Rafael Nadal told a Spanish TV station this week, when asked about the $T$ seedings. It is a little bit surprising to be honest, chimed Novak Djokovic later that afternoon.

That's feeding into the stereotypical ideology that $T$ are a thing of the past and they're gone now. Still, Radabaugh believes her hobby is a sign of respect. I'll never sell any of my collection, she said. I would never want to benefit off that.

Schneider catalogues and labels each one of his finds in his ever-growing collection of about 10,000 pieces, including flakes of flint, arrowheads, prehistoric $T$ made of rock and more. He urges all responsible collectors to do the same. There is a lot more involved to artifact hunting, Schneider said, than simply picking up a rock in a field. It requires a lot of research and love of history a passion that Carson certainly has. He said he wants to be an archaeologist when he grows up. I love the thrill of finding things and learning about the pieces I find, he said. It's cool that you can be the first one to touch something for thousands of years.

It's like an adult Easter egg hunt, explained Schneider, president of the Six River Valley chapter of the Archaeological Society of $T$ based in Westerville.

Artifact hunting is a pastime for many people in rural $T$ The state is home to the oldest and largest archaeological society in the United States with about 1,900 members, and the reason is simple, Schneider said.

$T$ is a major source of flint, which prehistoric Native Americans used to create tools and weapons dating back 14,000 years. The state also has many rivers and streams that flow through it, transporting artifacts. There is just a short window of time for artifact hunters to make their finds each year early in the summer. Even though pacing the rows of a giant field in the hot June sun may prove uncomfortable, the field is freshly tilled at this point, uncovering a new layer of soil potentially filled with artifacts. Rain settles the soil and washes dirt off the flint probably broken into fragments of the original arrowhead to reveal its natural, shiny black exterior. And crops aren't yet tall enough to cast a shadow to obstruct sight of the ground. Carson stumbled upon the hobby through a 4-H Club project on archery. While researching the sport, he came across Native American history and became infatuated with arrowheads and artifacts.

He did some research, found the local chapter of the Archaeological Society of $T$ and asked for a membership for Christmas. He is now the youngest member in the chapter. Schneider said he is thrilled to pass along his knowledge to the next generation. A majority of the organization is older, he said, and have been artifact hunting for decades. People such as Schneider were introduced to the hunt at a young age by their parents. Sue Radabaugh, 64, of Circleville, began hunting with her father when she was a child. It was a tremendous bonding experience that followed me into my adult life, she said. You pick something up that someone created thousands of years ago. It's been in this field for so long, and you've just found it.

Some have called into question the ethics of collecting arrowheads which in $T$ usually predate modern tribes and are from prehistoric eras both culturally and historically. Shannon Keller O'Loughlin, the executive director and attorney for the Association on American Indian Affairs, acknowledged the tension.

Brad Lepper, curator of archaeology at the $T$ History Connection, warned against the dangers of amateur hunting. It's really upsetting when amateurs cross the line looking for arrowheads by digging up burial mounds, he said. That's crossing the line into pillaging and looting, rather than following a legitimate hobby. Another issue is trespassing. Whereas experienced hunters know to seek out permission from the farmers whose land they hunt on, some amateurs wander into fields and disturb crops. The most important way to collect artifacts responsibly, Lepper said, is cataloguing finds and sharing that information with historians. For example, hunters should record where they find an artifact and ask a historian to date it for them.

Their finds can be added to the $T$ archaeological inventory database available to archaeologists. I was able to develop a settlement model from information dependent entirely on amateurs telling me where they found artifacts I was interested in, Lepper said. If they didn't write it out, that information is lost forever.

By WAYNE $T$ Associated Press ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) New Jersey took in more sports bets last month than Nevada did to lead the nation. Gambling regulators said this week that New Jersey handled nearly $319 million. That topped Nevada by about $2 million. New Jersey won a U.S. Supreme Court case in May 2018 that cleared the way for all 50 states to offer legal sports betting should they so choose. And it jumped into the market with both feet with the goal of dethroning Nevada as the sports betting capital of America. It remains to be seen if New Jersey can maintain its lead with large neighboring states including Pennsylvania and New York either offering sports betting or considering it.

The Olympic Games, of which basketball is a part and potentially could be huge for Canada assuming the $T$ commitments it received earlier this year still hold, took a step in assuring that remains a strong possibility when the decision was made to retain pretty much the same schedule in 2021 for the Games that would have existed in 2020.
National Basketball Association

There was talk that a later start date to the Olympics was in play and if that was the case, Canada's $T$ basketball involvement, as well as that of the USA team, would be in jeopardy much as it was last summer at the FIBA World Cup. The IOC's decision to schedule the Games for July 23-Aug 8 in 2021 should alleviate any concerns of players bailing because it's too close to training camp.

The only concern to $T$ participation next summer would be a change in the $T$ schedule. There already has been plenty of talk about moving the season back permanently to lessen the overlap with the NFL and take their chances with regular season baseball as competition for ticket buyers and TV ratings rather than the world-swallowing NFL reach.

If that occurs, these dates could be either too close to the end of the season or overlap the $T$ playoffs.

There already has been plenty of talk about moving the season back permanently to lessen the overlap with the NFL and take their chances with regular season baseball as competition for ticket buyers and $T$ ratings rather than the world-swallowing NFL reach. If that occurs, these dates could be either too close to the end of the season or overlap the NBA playoffs.

The Olympic Games, of which basketball is a part and potentially could be huge for $T$ assuming the NBA commitments it received earlier this year still hold, took a step in assuring that remains a strong possibility when the decision was made to retain pretty much the same schedule in 2021 for the Games that would have existed in 2020.

Let's use it to $T$ new things. Let's use it to lead the life that we want to lead, and when all of this will be over, keep these changes in mind. What I know, is that I will hopefully keep being more focused on what's meaningful in my life, and less inclined to waste my energy on what's not. Nobody knows how long it will last. In an article for the French website Futura-Sciences, the scientific writer Sol explains that the psychological effects of confinement will be multiplied beyond 10 days.

Containment only makes me miss calm and relaxing walks in nature or at the seaside, and $T$ in good company. We should stay positive, and find the good in the bad. It's an upheaval in our lifestyles. But it's also a great and unique moment to reflect on our lives. It's an unhoped-for moment to find out what we really like and don't like in our life, so we can readjust in consequence. Let's use it to do the things that we miss doing ordinarily. Let's use it to discover new things.

Most of them convey the same message containment puts $T$ in front of themselves. Suddenly, they have all the time they asked for. Suddenly, they even feel like they have too much time. This process frees up time for moments of reflection, and therefore of awareness. Suddenly, we have time to think. And thinking tends to refocus us. At least, this is what happened to me. As I observe myself spending my days, the things that I care about magically highlight by themselves. The things that I inherently like doing. It made me realize that a certain form of pressure was what made me feel the need to go out every single day .

Oilers Entertainment Group (OEG), which owns the Oilers and $T$ Oil Kings, says it will have a temporary staff reduction of 139 employees, effective April 13, as well as a compensation rollback for all other staff. The Montreal Canadiens were the first Canadian NHL team to announce temporary layoffs last week. CSEC says the rate of its salary reductions rises with salary levels, with executive management receiving the highest percentage rollbacks. It also says employees affected will receive a top-up payment from Employment Insurance. OEG, meanwhile, says it has created employee assistance funding to help its staff. Combined with government programs, OEG says staff will receive anywhere from 75 to 90 per cent of salaries. The Oilers' senior hockey and business executives decided last week they would forgo 50 to 100 per cent of their compensation during the crisis.

Hiring Bobby Hurley as coach five years ago was the biggest catalyst to the Sun Devils making the NCAA Tournament two years in a row. (Three, really, because they were a sure thing before the 2020 tournament was canceled.) Hurley was one of the great point guards in NCAA history, and in Martin he found a kindred spirit, someone who could take over a team, a game and a season.

Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle has ruled that $T$ law requires coffee companies to carry an ominous cancer warning label because of a chemical produced in the roasting process. Judge Berle wrote in a proposed ruling Wednesday, March 28, 2018, that Starbucks and other coffee companies failed to show that the threat from a chemical compound produced in the roasting process was insignificant. At the center of the dispute is acrylamide, a carcinogen found in many cooked foods, that is produced during the roasting process.

Trouble is brewing for coffee lovers in $T$ where a judge ruled that sellers must post scary warnings about cancer risks. But how frightened should we be of a daily cup of joe Not very, some scientists and available evidence seem to suggest. Scientific concerns about coffee have eased in recent years, and many studies even suggest it can help health. At the minimum, coffee is neutral. If anything, there is fairly good evidence of the benefit of coffee on cancer, said Dr. Edward Giovannucci, a nutrition expert at the Harvard School of Public Health. The World Health Organization's cancer agency moved coffee off the possible carcinogen list two years ago, though it says evidence is insufficient to rule out any possible role. The current flap isn't about coffee itself, but a chemical called acrylamide (ah-KRILL-ah-mide) that's made when the beans are roasted.

Dr. Otis Brawley, the $T$ chief medical officer, said, The issue here is dose, and the amount of acrylamide that would be included in coffee, which is really very small, compared to the amount from smoking tobacco. I don't think we should be worried about a cup of coffee.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets acrylamide limits for drinking water, but there aren't any for $T$ A cup of coffee a day, exposure probably is not that high, and probably should not change your habit, said Dr. Bruce Y. Lee of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. If you drink a lot of cups a day, this is one of the reasons you might consider cutting that down. Here's what's known about the risks. Start with the biggest known risk factor for cancer smoking which generates acrylamide. In the diet, French fries, potato chips, crackers, cookies, cereal and other high-carbohydrate foods contain it as a byproduct of roasting, baking, toasting or frying. Food and Drug Administration tests of acrylamide levels found they ranged from 175 to 351 parts per billion (a measure of concentration for a contaminant) for six brands of coffee tested the highest was for one type of decaf coffee crystals.

The International Food Information Council and Foundation, an organization funded mostly by the $T$ and beverage industry, says the law is confusing the public because it doesn't note levels of risk, and adds that U.S. dietary guidelines say up to five cups of coffee a day can be part of a healthy diet.

But $T$ and rodents absorb the chemical at different rates and metabolize it differently, so its relevance to $T$ health is unknown. A group of 23 scientists convened by the WHO's cancer agency in 2016 looked at coffee not acrylamide directly and decided coffee was unlikely to cause breast, prostate or pancreatic cancer, and that it seemed to lower the risks for liver and uterine cancers. Evidence was inadequate to determine its effect on dozens of other cancer types. Since 1986, businesses have been required to post warnings about chemicals known to cause cancer or other health risks more than 900 substances are on the state's list today but what's a significant risk is arguable. Coffee sellers and other defendants in the lawsuit that spurred Thursday's ruling have a couple weeks to challenge it or appeal.

The problem No one knows what levels are safe or risky for people. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets acrylamide limits for drinking water, but there aren't any for food.

While innovative, it is not necessarily a major player in the pharmacy world, bringing in about $T$ million in revenue last year. But its offer of a unique service - the easy-to-use packages - with a national reach made it an attractive prospect for Amazon, said industry analyst Adam Fein, chief executive of the Drug Channels Institute. Even as Americans have shifted their buying habits online, about 90 per cent of all prescriptions are filled at a pharmacy counter, according to research firm Iqvia. If Amazon can break that habit, it could significantly upend the industry, said Mr Stephen Buck, a pharmaceutical supply-chain expert who co-founded drug-price website GoodRx. It helps people to eliminate that trip and buy everything they need from Amazon, he added.

The truth is that anything connected to the $T$ can be hacked. However, hacking always a problem.The History of Air Gap Technology. Data used to be held offline, in now known as cold storage. Data on external paper cards, then moved to tape and digital media as technology evolved. The first computers built were by default on cold storage or air gap technology. Even when networks were initially built, much of the data still had to be manually connected to the system by adding in the media to a device. In the early days, sensitive codes and information were kept locked in vaults accessible by an authorized individual or in some cases, by multiple people required to key in simultaneously. This approach was the genesis of multi-signature authorization.

$T$ built vaults within mountains for the long-term cold storage. Since the founding of this company, many other institutions offering deep cold storage have entered the market. Most recently, the Winklevoss twins announced a cryptocurrency-based patent in the air gap space, lending even more credibility to the application of the technology. The solutions all rely on a combination of codes on digital or physical (paper or other) media in coordination with some vaulting solution. These options are great if you need to access your keys to make trades however, trading is a key to doing business. Story Continues All of these solutions have the same issue which has vexed institutional investors for years entirely locking them out of the market in many cases and that problem is accessibility.

The typical solution, like $T$ requires a 2-day notice to bring your keys online manually for you to make a transaction. This delay means these solutions meet the needs of active investors who need access at a notice. Additionally, the additional human interaction point represents a significant risk to data.

To pay for projects outlined in the measures, $T$ City Schools may use a combination of sources including bond-sale proceeds, development fees and any available state funding. I see huge need for repairing facilities that are 50-plus years old, said MCS Superintendent Sara Noguchi, who was hired as top administrator in June. Our classrooms are not where they need to be for teaching 21st Century skills.

$T$ City Schools has estimated a need for $1 billion in renovations and improvements when high school campuses are included in the mix. High school renovations are not on the ballot this time, however. When you look at the billion-dollar book, the high schools have as many needs as the elementary campuses, Trustee Chad Brown said last week. One focus of Measure D is elementary school cafeterias, some of which remained the same size as enrollment doubled at campuses over the years.

At Shackelford $T$ in south Modesto, the small cafeteria starts serving food at a.m. for kindergartners other grades are served in 10-minute shifts until 6th graders are finished eating at p.m. The school, originally built in 1945, also needs a redesign out front to create a single access point for visitors, district staff said.

A larger cafeteria is just one of the urgent needs at Franklin $T$ near Emerald Avenue and Maze Boulevard. On a tour with district officials last week, Franklin was described as an old facility where things are falling apart, including portable classrooms with peeled paint and rotted siding makeshift offices that are nothing more than converted trailers cracked blacktop and little shade for the kids. There is no turn-in for buses in front of the K-6 school, which has nearly 900 students. The gravel parking lot on the opposite side of Emerald Avenue is donated by Gallo Winery. Principal Scott Genzmer helps direct the traffic as students go home at the final bell. The classroom environment to me says a lot, Genzmer said.

She was with two of her young children when she got into difficulty in the water and could not be revived, police said. Karen Sampson, who started an online campaign to raise funds for the Williamson family, said Ms Williamson, was a loving mother to her two children, Robbie and Kathryn. She was a much loved member of our local community and will be missed dearly, she wrote.

The crested ibis was classified as Extinct in the Wild on the $T$ Red List in 1998 after all five remaining wild ibis in Japan were captured in 1981. Since then, the species has maintained the rank for 20 years. The classification of Extinct in the Wild is the second-highest rank on the ministry's Red List after Extinct, and means particular plants or animals only survive in captivity, cultivation or as a naturalized population outside its original habitat. While the last Japan-born ibis died in captivity in 2003, Japan succeeded in artificial breeding of the birds in 1999, using a pair given by China. Ten artificially bred birds were also released into the wild for the first time in 2008, and their successful natural breeding was confirmed in 2012.

When I last wrote about $T$ ( RAMP ), it was still part of $T$ ( ACXM ), from which it officially spun-off on September 21, 2018.

Since it has been a few months since the spin-off, I wanted to discuss $T$ performance following its split with $T$ because the division was $T$ growth engine at the time, and it's important for investors to know if $T$ has lived up to expectations. Since the split on September 21, RAMP has fallen from $50.90 to $38.58 per share. XLK data by YCharts Thus, RAMP has lost approximately a quarter of its value in 3 months, but as with all stocks, everything is relative.
LiveRamp
1
That is why I included XLK, a technology ETF, because $T$ is a technology company, and XLK provides a reasonable benchmark to gauge the company's performance. Looking at XLK's performance over the last 3 months, it is down over XLK data by YCharts A majority of stocks seem to be moving in the same direction on a given day due to broad investor concerns stemming from Fed interest rate hikes, and Trump's trade wars. In the short-term everything seems correlated as large players either inject or withdraw cash from the markets daily in anticipation of political issues, but I will be focusing on RAMP's fundamentals, since that will determine its price in the long-term. The thing that sticks out immediately from RAMP's assets is Assets held for sale. The current assets Assets held for sale figure grew from $138 million in March, to over $700 million in September.
LiveRamp
-1
Of course, the overall figure did not grow out of thin air $550 million worth of Assets held for sale migrated from long-term assets to current assets since all of $T$ will be sold off in less than a year.
LiveRamp

So, why is this important The reason is due to the timing of $T$ $500 million tender offer. The company initiated this tender offer on November 13, 2018 with an expiration date of December 12, 2018. The offering price was between $49 and $44.50.
LiveRamp
-1
To estimate how much stock $T$ bought back, I calculated a volume-weighted average of the stock's daily closing price each day in the tender offer period. Assuming all $500 million was spent in this tender offer, RAMP bought back around 10.85 million shares.
LiveRamp
-1
Now that the share price stands at $38.58, $T$ could be down $80 million on the shares it bought back, which is $80 million that could have been used for marketing, research, etc.
LiveRamp

The timing of the tender offer was unlucky, but the offer price range itself did convey confidence that $T$ expects its share price to increase due to higher growth.

(Source $T$ Q2 10-Q) For the six month period ended September 30, 2018 revenue was $127.3 million. This represented a 26 increase from 2017's revenue of $100.8 million for the same period. For a company pioneering a new service with lots of potential, I expected 35 growth between these periods. One thing RAMP has to execute well on is marketing. They have the service fleshed out and ready to implement, but their name recognition is weak, especially after the spin-off.
LiveRamp

However, from the earnings call I discuss in the next section, the CEO mentioned that RAMP has enlisted the services of Laura Desmond (former Starcom CEO) to evangelize $T$ services with businesses that deal with data. Thus, it could take a few quarters to see growth truly kickstart as name recognition of this company's services grow. Although revenue growth was below my expectations, the scalability of RAMP's offerings is impressive. Cost of revenue only rose $50,000 in 2018, which is essentially level with 2017's figure. As a result, gross margin increased from 52 in 2017 to 62 in 2018.
LiveRamp
1
In 2019, if revenue increases 35 and the cost of revenue grows the same amount, then gross margin could become That is what makes $T$ an attractive company their services become more effective with a larger network of customers, while product costs remain nearly flat as time goes on. Some other good signs include marketing expenses growing which shows management is keen on increasing revenue quickly. Also, the $4 million decrease in demonstrates their ability to keep overhead low.
LiveRamp
1
Seeing that the 2018 operating loss was $67.8 million, $10 million less than last period, once revenues pick up, $T$ can start slowing down on marketing expenses. So, three years is likely how long it will take for them to start breaking even and turning an operating profit.

Design Thinking is a $T$ approach to innovation that draws from the toolkit to integrate the needs of $T$ the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success (Brown, 2009, pg. In addition, by emulating the designer, a business can create innovative solutions to challenging problems, usually by teams with varied backgrounds (Moggridge, 2010). Furthermore, Design Thinkers can be traditional designers or those with analytical backgrounds but by using the framework, individuals can unlock their creative confidence (Kelley and Kelley, 2013, pg.4). d.School Stanford, IDEO and the British Design Council are most frequently mentioned as pioneers of the approach.

The differences between the two vehicles are on the inside. Seating in the second row is identical in measurement, with 34.4 inches of legroom. The third row of seating has 28.3 inches of legroom a little better than the Cadillac 24.8 inches, but not as good as the extended wheelbase Cadillac Escalade 34.5 inches. Any third row with less than 30 inches of legroom will be cramped for adults, in my experience, but you get many complaints from teens and youngsters.

The luggage space has a flat floor, too no folded seat to block loading. Losing the third row shaves 200 lbs off of the curb weight, from 6,000 lbs to 5,800 lbs. Performance and fuel economy numbers for the two-row and three-row LX are stated as matching, with 0-60 mph runs clocking in at 7.3 seconds and EPA fuel economy ratings at 13 mpg mpg mpg combined but losing 200 lbs has to make the two-row a skosh quicker and more efficient, it uncaptioned image LX 570 dash.

The naturally aspirated (non-turbo) 5.7-liter V8 engine and eight-speed automatic transmission with standard all-wheel drive are perfectly matched to the big SUV, giving a great sense of momentum to each drive.

But it's a dangerous gamble if the parties couldn't agree on the make-up of that alternative administration, Parliament would dissolve 14 days later for the election that Johnson has asked for and that the opposition has so far refused to give him. With Parliament broken up, MPs would have no power to stop Johnson completing a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31. How Johnson fares in any election may be determined by the public reaction to allegations that call his integrity into question. On Sunday evening Johnson's office took the unusual step of flatly denying one claim, that around 20 years ago he inappropriately touched the leg of a junior journalist working on the magazine he was then editing. On another claim about his private life, the denial was more circumspect.

Earlier in the week, Scott met with local mayors, farmers, consultants and community to discuss the implications of the new legislative standards. He said it had created a wave of anger across the Wairarapa electorate and that many he spoke with expressed feelings of betrayal. The resounding message I have heard is frustration at being excluded from a process, the unrealistic time frames and the lack of any understanding about on-farm reality from the Ministry for the Environment.

In many functional $T$ libraries, there is a function called The name might be different from which library you use, but the core concept is the same. f ((w x), (x y), (y z), ) A compose function takes one or more than one function. This compose function performs left-to-right function composition. The leftmost function may take any arity. Once the leftmost function returns a value, the next leftmost function takes the result and returns its return value, and this process keeps going until the rightmost function returns a result. const compose (fn, .fns) gt (.v) gt fns.reduce((r, f) gt f(r), fn.apply(this, v)) Of course, the real compose function may look much more complex and difficult and also well-organized.

$T$ spoke with five venture capitalists about the startups that had the biggest impact on the tech world throughout the 2010s. They noted that companies like Theranos and WeWork demonstrated the pitfalls of founder worship and the pursuit of growth at all costs. But startups like Dollar Shave Club and Warby Parker stand out as companies that have successfully built direct relationships with consumers. Stitch Fix and Rent The Runway are showing investors the promise of women-led ventures in an industry that grossly lacks diversity, while Shopify and Atlassian have proven that markets outside of Silicon Valley are taking off.

Eterneva announced recently that the company would be placing more emphasis on scientific transparency through a partnership with $T$ and Laboratories in College Station, Texas. In a video posted to the Eterneva Instagram account, the company has various samples of human remains tested at the labs in College Station to show that they contain enough carbon to create diamonds.

Yes, there is carbon here, said $T$ analytical and chemistry lab manager Mike Gaskins. The lab found that the samples provided by Eterneva contained 3.28 carbon from ashes from cremation, 36.6 carbon from a hair sample and 16.91 carbon from ashes formed by aquamation - a water and chemical-based alternative to cremation. We get more than enough carbon to grow diamonds for our customers, said Eterneva laboratory manager Abraham Levy.

It's pretty unlikely at this time, said the president during today's coronavirus task force press briefing in the White House Rose Garden. We're letting the governors do in their states pretty much what they want, with our supervision. Obviously, there are parts of the country that are in far deeper trouble than others, he said. Other parts are frankly not in trouble at all and hopefully we're going to be able to keep it that way by doing what we're doing. Since Saturday, a majority of governors have issued executive orders mandating that residents stay at home. As pressure has mounted on the holdouts, the total number of states in shutdown mode has risen to 32.

It made me realize that a certain form of pressure was what made me feel the need to go out every single day .

Vapor intrusion occurs when contamination moves from $T$ and soil beneath a structure into the air, accumulating in occupied areas where they can result in safety hazards or health effects. Common vapor-forming chemicals include volatile organic compounds including trichloroethylene (TCE), mercury, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), and certain pesticides. Testing for vapor intrusion is an important step in investigating a potential development site, and in ensuring the health and safety of existing residential and commercial buildings. The Supplemental Guidance, which was developed collaboratively by the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, and the State Water Resources Control Board, is intended to increase the consistency of testing methods. It will also improve the reliability of data resulting from VI testing, which will be compiled into a planned statewide VI database through the State Water GeoTracker online system.
