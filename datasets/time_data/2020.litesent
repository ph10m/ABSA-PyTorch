In the first $T$ cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same. Combining Scholar Education Group's Debt And Its 17 Return On Equity Although Scholar Education Group does use debt, its debt to equity ratio of 0.11 is still low. The combination of modest debt and a very respectable ROE suggests this is a business worth watching. Careful use of debt to boost returns is often very good for shareholders. However, it could reduce the company's ability to take advantage of future opportunities. The Key Takeaway Return on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business.

It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets. What Does Return On Equity Signify Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business -LRB- plus any capital injections -RRB-.

I usually take a closer look when a company has a better ROE than industry peers. One data point to check is if insiders have bought shares recently.

That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares -LRB- equity -RRB-, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.

There have been reports that a British private equity firm has offered more than $100m in credit to assist the NRL and Australian rugby may be hoping to secure similar assistance. But if Rugby Australia wanted to attract private investment in Super Rugby, and maybe the Wallabies, it would probably need to lessen its financial controls over the franchises.

On Monday, Trudeau released new details of the program including that it would be open to a wide-swath of businesses with no cap on the number of employees. This is about making sure that people are still getting paid whether they work for a business that employs 10 people or a 1,000 people, he said. To qualify businesses must have a drop in revenue related to COVID-19 of at least 30 per cent.

I spoke with Jack Donson who has over 23 years of experience in the $T$ who told me, There have been natural disasters that required the movement of inmates from things like hurricanes or floods, but never anything on a national scale that called for the mass release of inmates at risk of harm. Donson said that an agency this size tends to not move quickly and coordination with other agencies is going to be paramount. I also reached out to Joe Rojas, Southeast Regional Vice President at Council of Prison Locals who told me that his primary concern is still the lack of Personal Protective Equipment -LRB- PPE -RRB- and the transportation of inmates within the prison system. Our staff members do not have the proper protection and new inmates coming into the system are causing more pressures on staff, Rojas said. The prison population is not only vulnerable to contagion but it also puts pressure on community health care.

The trouble is that in far worse shape than in 2008, when a $T$ lending boom helped revive growth. why a cut in the deposit rate is long overdue. The Bank of China is in discussions to lower the interest rate banks pay on deposits for the first time since 2015 and a decision could be announced within days, the Financial Times reported last week, citing people familiar with the deliberations. A reduction would shore up banks profitability, buying lenders breathing room as authorities lean on them to support companies that are struggling to stay afloat after a shutdown that affected two-thirds of the economy.

Such banks have more small and medium-size enterprises among their $T$ clients and also lend out more of their deposits. Even the big four could do with some relief. While better capitalized and more profitable than the rest, they bear the burden of being the principal policy tool, requiring them to hand out low-interest loans and help out struggling smaller banks. The bigger question is how much difference even lower deposit rates will make given the scale of the challenge the economy faces.

Analysts say a cut in the central $T$ lending facility rate, its main policy tool, far away. That in turn will influence the loan prime rate, set by 18 banks once a month. Smaller banks outside the big four of Industrial Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. will be the biggest beneficiaries of lower rates for time deposits. These account for a large portion of customer accounts at lenders such as Bank of Communications Co. and Ping An Bank Co., according to to CGS-CIMB Securities Ltd. analyst Michael Chang.

BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink predicted the economy will eventually recover from the coronavirus outbreak, though he said the crisis will reshape investor psychology, business practices and consumer habits.

In my 44 years in finance, I have never experienced anything like this, Fink wrote, adding that as dramatic as this has been, I do believe that the economy will recover steadily, in part because this situation lacks some of the obstacles to recovery of a typical financial crisis.

By RECORDER REPORT on March 31, 2020 $T$ is closing its famous malls and halting all passenger flights, capping a series of shutdowns on once-thriving sectors that serve as its economic lifeline but which have been sacrificed to curb coronavirus. A few days after barring foreigners, including those with residency permits, from entering the country, the emirate said it would close its airports to commercial flights, shut shopping centres and restrict restaurants to home deliveries. Within hours of the announcement, which will be enforced by Wednesday, the city's vast malls were already largely deserted, with corridors and concourses empty and shops devoid of customers.

And for those investors who keep their eyes not on the shaky ground at our feet, but on the horizon ahead, there are tremendous opportunities to be had in today's markets.

By RECORDER REPORT on March 31, 2020 $T$ is crying out for debt relief to weather a perfect storm of coronavirus, plummeting oil and commodity prices, mounting budget deficits and weaker currencies. But delivering the relief that would allow governments to pump resources into creaking healthcare systems and shield economies against the fallout from the pandemic is a tall order. When the International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- and World Bank launched their Heavily Indebted Poor Countries -LRB- HIPC -RRB- debt relief programme in 1996, African nations mainly owed money to wealthy countries and multilateral institutions.

In $T$ view, this is troublesome because debt might become harder to service over the coming years for obvious reasons. For that reason, we need to take a closer look at the repayment schedule and other relevant variables. The following table describes the amounts due over the next several years, and the percentage total that represents. The company has cash on hand in the amount of $145 million and about $487 million of undrawn short-term lines and the $500 million credit facility cited under note 9 of the latest 10-K. Also, fully $200 million of the debt due in 2020 can be extended at the company's option. All of this, plus the low rate of interest on most of this debt suggests to me that the company is reasonably well positioned to get over the debt payable over the next two years.

This is relevant in $T$ view. Source Ycharts In addition to looking at simple price earnings multiples, I also want to review the assumptions currently embedded in the price of the shares.

In the book, Penman walks an investor through how they isolate the g -LRB- growth -RRB- variable in a standard finance formula to work out what the market must be thinking about a given business.

Options For the Nervous Though the current price is reasonable in $T$ view, I understand why investors would be hesitant to buy at the moment. Obviously, short-term earnings are going to be lower than past earnings, and there's a reasonable fear that the shares will be taken down in another downturn. I think the options market provides an opportunity to access the shares of this company at a much lower, less risky price. This is why I generally call short put options a win-win trade. If the shares remain above the strike price, the investor simply pockets the premium. If the shares fall in price, the investor is obliged to buy, but they do so at a price that they determined to be a good long-term entry point.

The first few months of this year have so far been unkind to shareholders of $T$ Products Co. -LRB-  SON  -RRB-, with the stock down over 31 since January 1st. I thought I'd look in on this name to determine whether it was a good buy at these prices, or whether it's possible to make money in the options market here. I'll try to answer that question by looking at the financial history here, paying particular attention to the capital structure and the debt repayment schedule. I'll look at the stock as a thing distinct from the underlying business, and I'll recommend a specific short options trade. For those who have little interest in wading through the remainder of my article, I'll jump to the point.

Oil prices could possibly go negative, some analysts say, due to lack of demand amid the ongoing $T$ pandemic and increased production due to a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Paul Sankey, managing director at Mizuho Securities, told Fox Business earlier this month that oil companies might not be able to store all the oil that is being produced, and would pay buyers to take the commodity of their hands. The effect of negative oil prices would hurt the U.S. shale industry. President Trump instructed the Department of Energy to purchase oil for the reserves earlier this month but the U.S. government is still trying to determine how to finance the purchasing operation.

The $T$ has caused demand for oil to drop, as countries around the world have shut down non-essential businesses to prevent the spread of the disease. Saudi Arabia has urged Russia to cut production due to the drop in demand but Russia refused. Both countries have been increasing production of oil in a race for market share.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs, however, have said that $T$ is the bigger challenge for the oil industry, rather than the Russia-Saudi price war. Big Oil will consolidate the best assets in the industry and will shed the worst. when the industry emerges from this downturn, there will be fewer companies of higher asset quality, but the capital constraints will remain, the analysts wrote in a note on Monday. The oil price war is made irrelevant by the large decline in demand and has made a coordinated supply response impossible to achieve in time, the note continued. Oil is just one of the many struggling industries that may contribute to global economic fears.

The ability of many households to face any kind of financial disruption was already limited. Now all Canadians are feeling the effects on their paycheques, pocketbooks, and stock portfolios. Those who were already saddled with a lot of debt are in economic survival mode, said Bazian. Almost half of Canadians said they were concerned about their current debt levels, a 10-point jump from the previous wave in December and the highest percentage ever recorded since tracking began in 2017.

The $T$ crisis is delivering an unprecedented financial shock to Canadians at a time when their personal finances were already fragile, says insolvency accounting firm MNP. The MNP Consumer Debt Index, released Monday, found that about half of Canadians are now on the brink of insolvency, saying they are $200 or less away from not being able to meet their debt obligations each month. A quarter of these said they are already unable to meet those obligations. Our results underscore how vulnerable Canadian households are to income interruption. Over the next few months likely see an unfolding of two crises the global pandemic and the bursting of the Canadian consumer debt bubble, said Grant Bazian, MNP president.

Amarin strongly disagrees with the ruling and will vigorously pursue all available remedies, including an appeal of the Court's decision and a preliminary injunction pending appeal to, if an ANDA is approved by FDA, prevent launch of generic versions of VASCEPA in the United States, said John $T$ Thero, president and chief executive officer of Amarin. At Amarin, we have a strong balance sheet with capacity and flexibility, and we plan to fight to protect our VASCEPA franchise for the benefit of our patients, physicians, the broader healthcare community and our investors. We believe we are favorably situated to obtain an injunction against generic launch pending appeal, subject to our posting a bond to secure generics' lost profits in the event that generics prevail on appeal.

There can be no guarantee we would be successful in any of such efforts.

These $T$ statements are not promises or guarantees and involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described or projected herein include the following uncertainties associated generally with the commercial success of pharmaceutical products such as VASCEPA the risk of loss in the planned appeal of the Court's judgment and in seeking preliminary injunction that patent applications may not result in issued patents, and that issued patents may not prevent competitors from competing with VASCEPA the risk that new competitors may further challenge the exclusivity afforded by the same patents at issue in this litigation through a new litigation or otherwise seek to gain marketing approval for generic versions of VASCEPA or branded competitive products based on new clinical studies and the risk that trade secrets may not be maintained and that other circumstances that create barriers to competition with VASCEPA may not last.

These $T$ statements are not promises or guarantees and involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

In the $T$ alone, a heart attack, stroke, death or other major cardiovascular event is experienced every 14 seconds. Controlling bad cholesterol, also known as LDL-C, is one way to reduce a patient's risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event. However, even with the achievement of target LDL-C levels, millions of patients still have significant and persistent cardiovascular risk, especially those patients with high triglycerides. Statin therapy has been shown to control LDL-C, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular events by 25-35 but that still leaves 65-75 of risk remaining.

Our 2019 average production was $T$ within our guidance range of $T$ to $T$ We came in below guidance on capital, operating and general and administrative expenses as a result of several efficiencies, specifically cost reduction and restructuring initiatives that took place throughout the year. Our capital execution was strong in 2019, as we continued to build on our success in the Willesden Green area of the Cardium, with the drilling of 19 net operated Cardium locations -LRB- 96 working interest -RRB-. These wells delivered strong initial rates and continue to produce as expected -LRB- IP60 385 79 light oil per well -RRB-.

Our capital expenditures were $103 million, below our guidance of $108 million, as we were successful in reducing our costs per well to $3.7 million for the year averaging $3.5 million for the second half of the year with an average horizontal length of over $T$ meters. These costs are inclusive of all construction, drilling, completions, equipping, and gathering system expenditures. We made significant progress in the management of our decommissioning liabilities.

These $T$ wells demonstrated very similar completions flowback rates to three other new wells in the vicinity that will be brought on stream in April. Obsidian Energy is actively reviewing our portfolio considering the current commodity price outlook and has shut-in volumes deemed temporarily uneconomic to produce and has lowered our first half 2020 production estimate by 600 This reduction is composed almost entirely of heavy oil and associated gas production in the Peace River area.

Including these actions, the Company expects average production for the first half of 2020 to be within guidance of $T$ The Company will continue to optimize the production base against the anticipated volatile commodity price environment and is prepared to shut-in additional volumes should we deem it economically prudent. In addition, the Company has identified in excess of $10 million in operating and general and administrative reductions over our original 2020 plan and will continue to seek opportunities to lower costs in all aspects of our business. We are continuing our participation in the ABC program for 2020. Our focus in the first quarter of 2020 has been in the Sousa and Lennard Creek fields in Northwest Alberta , where working in frozen conditions allowed our work to be conducted most efficiently.

UPDATED CORPORATE PRESENTATION For further information on these and other matters, Obsidian Energy has posted an updated Corporate Presentation which can be found on its website, www.obsidianenergy.com ADDITIONAL READER ADVISORIES OIL AND GAS INFORMATION ADVISORY Barrels of oil equivalent may be misleading, particularly if used $T$ isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency conversion ratio of utilizing a conversion on a basis is misleading as an indication of value.

Net Loss Adjusted EBTIDA EPS Cash Equiv Total Assets Total Liabilities Now, a quick look at this might worry investors, as operating expenses tripled, net loss widened to $T$ million, and EPS decreased to $T$ The reason behind the huge gap in operating expenses and net loss are attributed to Pinterest's IPO.

$T$ million had to be paid in share-based compensation in 2019, whereas only $15 million was paid in 2018. Share-based compensations should not be as large for FY20, so net loss should begin to shrink, assuming expenses associated with research and development do not skyrocket. Revenue growth has been around $300 million per year, and Pinterest's growth metrics, per user and per user revenues, have grown substantially as well. Since Q4 2016, Pinterest has shown consistent growth in its monthly active user base, with only one quarter -LRB- Q2 2018 -RRB- showing a decline. US-based active monthly users have grown from approximately 70 million to 88 million, while international has grown from 90 million to 247 million.

Quarterly revenues were published at $400 million for Q4 2019, of which the United States user base contributed even though that user base only contributes to $T$ of the monthly active user base worldwide.

Looking at quarterly average revenue per user, as reported, the United States users contributed $4.00, and international $T$ Quarterly ARPU trends for United States are steadily increasing, whereas international ARPU is slightly more volatile. One thing to note here is that while Pinterest has shown a substantially higher increase in monthly active users worldwide as opposed to in the United States, ARPU for international users is only a fraction of United States users. The company acknowledges prioritizing its earliest monetization efforts in the United and subsequently has less experience and knowledge of how to sufficiently monetize internationally to capture its growing user base at its potential.
2
-1
Even with an average ARPU of $0.90, just about one-third of US ARPU, Pinterest would earn approximately $T$ billion from its international user base. Yet, Pinterest still has not started focusing on monetizing this international user base that it has accumulated, even though net revenues could be much higher if ARPU was increased. Why Is United States Growth Small With the US active monthly user base contributing about four-fifths or more of total revenues and only one-fourth of active users, why has Pinterest not been able to grow this user base at the same rate as international The answer to this might lie in the pricing behind Pinterest's advertising, which is its source of revenue. Advertisements on social media platforms are typically priced on cost-per-click -LRB- CPC -RRB- or cost-per-impression -LRB- CPM -RRB- basis.

Facebook, with the highest average active monthly users, has an average CPC just under $T$ and can charge this premium over Twitter with its user base.

Pinterest's average of $T$.50 per click is higher than that of Facebook and Twitter, and could be a reason that advertisers are preferring to use Twitter and Facebook with Twitter, average CPC is $T$ of Pinterest's and active monthly users are nearly identical Facebook's active monthly user base of over $T$ billion makes the average $0.97 per click very attractive to advertisers.

Pinterest Still is Risky In its 10-K , Pinterest outlined $T$ pages of risk factors to the company performance. Mentioned briefly at the beginning of the article, Pinterest's main issues arise from maintaining and growing its user base, competition from other social media platforms -LRB- especially those with lower costs of advertising and larger active user bases -RRB-, operating expenses growing to scale the business, and the retention of existing and acquisition of new advertisers to drive revenues. One key factor to note is the source of Pinterest's current advertisers the company does realize that a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of advertisers and is currently concentrated in certain verticals, particularly consumer packaged goods and retail.

Pinterest's revenue streams may not push it to profitability with the next fiscal year or $T$ and the business model comes with significant risks to performance.

Conclusion Pinterest remains a risky play due to the nature of the $T$ market, its inability to generate any profits as of yet, and its higher average cost of advertising on its platform. Many small businesses use Pinterest as their mode of advertisement, but if their finances are struck down by the coronavirus outbreak, their ability to advertise on Pinterest might change. Pinterest's heavy reliability of consumer packaged goods and retail in the US market to generate revenues could cause issues with short-term sector disruptions. The company needs to be able to generate more revenues from its international segment by increasing ARPU significantly and prove that it can do it soon. Pinterest's revenue streams may not push it to profitability with the next fiscal year or two, and the business model comes with significant risks to performance.

When and whether Pinterest will do this is still unknown, but the sooner the better for its overall profitability and revenue growth.

Even with an average ARPU of $0.90, just about one-third of $T$ ARPU, Pinterest would earn approximately $1 billion from its international user base.

United States of America

Pinterest still lacks in efficient monetization of its international users, and relies all too heavily on slowly growing $T$ users to generate a majority of its revenue. Conclusion Pinterest remains a risky play due to the nature of the online advertising market, its inability to generate any profits as of yet, and its higher average cost of advertising on its platform. Many small businesses use Pinterest as their mode of advertisement, but if their finances are struck down by the coronavirus outbreak, their ability to advertise on Pinterest might change.

Pinterest's heavy reliability of consumer packaged goods and retail in the $T$ market to generate revenues could cause issues with short-term sector disruptions. The company needs to be able to generate more revenues from its international segment by increasing ARPU significantly and prove that it can do it soon. Pinterest's revenue streams may not push it to profitability with the next fiscal year or two, and the business model comes with significant risks to performance.

Breaking Down $T$ The majority of social media platforms today are worldwide, and $T$ is no exception.
Pinterest
-1
In reporting its 2019 full-year results, $T$ stated that ads are now served in 28 countries, an 300 increase from seven at the end of 2018 monthly active users hit 335 million. Revenues increased by 51 YoY to $1,142.8 million.
Pinterest
1
Even with this revenue increase, $T$ details a very long section of company risk factors to future performance. Included are user base retention to sustain revenues, new advertiser attraction to grow revenues, possible difficulties with monetization and growth scaling, and a continuation of operating losses and unreliability of future profit generation.
Pinterest
-1
$T$ also states that its past performances are not indicative of future results. However, a quick look at its financials from 2017 to 2019, as well as global growth trends, shows potential for growth. all in M Revenues Total Op. Net Loss Adjusted EBTIDA EPS Cash Equiv Total Assets Total Liabilities Now, a quick look at this might worry investors, as operating expenses tripled, net loss widened to $1,361 million, and EPS decreased to -3.24.
Pinterest
1
The reason behind the huge gap in operating expenses and net loss are attributed to $T$ IPO. $1,378 million had to be paid in share-based compensation in 2019, whereas only $15 million was paid in 2018. Share-based compensations should not be as large for FY20, so net loss should begin to shrink, assuming expenses associated with research and development do not skyrocket.
Pinterest
-1
Revenue growth has been around $300 million per year, and $T$ growth metrics, per user and per user revenues, have grown substantially as well.
Pinterest
1
Since Q4 2016, $T$ has shown consistent growth in its monthly active user base, with only one quarter -LRB- Q2 2018 -RRB- showing a decline. US-based active monthly users have grown from approximately 70 million to 88 million, while international has grown from 90 million to 247 million. Quarterly revenues were published at $400 million for Q4 2019, of which the United States user base contributed even though that user base only contributes to 25 of the monthly active user base worldwide. Looking at quarterly average revenue per user, as reported, the United States users contributed $4.00, and international $0.21. Quarterly ARPU trends for United States are steadily increasing, whereas international ARPU is slightly more volatile.
Pinterest
1
One thing to note here is that while $T$ has shown a substantially higher increase in monthly active users worldwide as opposed to in the United States, ARPU for international users is only a fraction of United States users. The company acknowledges prioritizing its earliest monetization efforts in the United and subsequently has less experience and knowledge of how to sufficiently monetize internationally to capture its growing user base at its potential.
Pinterest
-1
Should $T$ be able to capitalize on international monetization sooner, rather than later and run the risk of competition stealing market share, and bring its international ARPU up from $0.21, its revenue stream could pop higher.

Why Is United States Growth Small With the US active monthly user base contributing about four-fifths or more of total revenues and only one-fourth of active users, why has $T$ not been able to grow this user base at the same rate as international The answer to this might lie in the pricing behind $T$ advertising, which is its source of revenue. Advertisements on social media platforms are typically priced on cost-per-click -LRB- CPC -RRB- or cost-per-impression -LRB- CPM -RRB- basis. Some platforms like YouTube and Twitter price ads based on engagement and views, for example, but CPC and CPM -LRB- which is typically 1,000 impressions -RRB- are the primary determinants of ad prices.

CPM Facebook Twitter Instagram $T$ owned by Facebook Source WebFX Of the four, Twitter has the lowest average advertising costs on both a CPC and CPM basis keep in mind advertisements are done by bids and costs could be much higher or lower than the average.

Facebook, with the highest average active monthly users, has an average CPC just under $1 and can charge this premium over Twitter with its user base.
Pinterest
-1
$T$ average of $1.50 per click is higher than that of Facebook and Twitter, and could be a reason that advertisers are preferring to use Twitter and Facebook with Twitter, average CPC is 25 of $T$ and active monthly users are nearly identical Facebook's active monthly user base of over 2 billion makes the average $0.97 per click very attractive to advertisers.

$T$ Still is Risky In its 10-K , $T$ outlined 25 pages of risk factors to the company performance.
Pinterest
-1
Mentioned briefly at the beginning of the article, $T$ main issues arise from maintaining and growing its user base, competition from other social media platforms -LRB- especially those with lower costs of advertising and larger active user bases -RRB-, operating expenses growing to scale the business, and the retention of existing and acquisition of new advertisers to drive revenues.
Pinterest
-1
One key factor to note is the source of $T$ current advertisers the company does realize that a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of advertisers and is currently concentrated in certain verticals, particularly consumer packaged goods and retail. Having such a concentration in just two sectors, should one of the two start to decline in influence on the platform, could have significant adverse effects on revenues, even if user base still grows.
Pinterest
-1
$T$ needs to diversify, at least a bit to other sectors, in order to lessen the effect should one falter.
Pinterest
0
There is no valid proof that their business model will be successful in attracting new advertisement growth, that revenues growth occurs and that $T$ becomes profitable, as outlined in the 10-K. Online advertising is fierce, with new platforms and modes of engagement susceptible to change rapidly -LRB- see the rise of TikTok as an example -RRB-.

$T$ still lacks in efficient monetization of its international users, and relies all too heavily on slowly growing US users to generate a majority of its revenue.

The equity strategists at Bloomberg Intelligence note that in recent days, reactions to earnings downgrades and buyback suspensions also turned positive, perhaps indicating most bad news is already in the price. More specifically, they point out that stocks of companies that pared their earnings-growth targets did better over the past week than those with a higher bar, suggesting a considerable amount of negativity is reflected in prices.

Commercial and industrial loans outstanding surged by $176.2 billion, or to $2.55 trillion in the latest weekly period, $T$ data released late Friday showed. by far the most in any week going back to 1973. The good news is that big lenders are perceived to be better capitalized than at any time in history, which diminishes the possibility of a bank collapse. Still, that mean their earnings take a hit. That may help explain why the KBW Bank 40.1 plunge this year is more than double that of the 500 18.7 drop. CONSUMER everyone agrees that the U.S. economy is headed into a recession, and may already be in one. How deep and long-lasting the contraction is depends on a host of factors, not the least of which is the financial health of consumers. In that regard, the prognosis is mixed. On the downside, 25 of U.S. workers make less than $600 a week, and delinquency rates on all types of consumer loans are the highest in about six years, according to Deutsche Bank strategist Torsten Slok.

Does this mean the carnage is over Nobody can say for sure, and for every $T$ firm saying yes, another warning that the worst is yet to come. Yet, there was a lot to like about how markets gained at the start of the week. What was most encouraging about the latest action is that it came despite a slew of news that, one would think, would be negative for riskier assets. Yes, the news out of Abbott Laboratories that it has developed a coronavirus test that can tell if someone is infected in as little as five minutes did a lot to boost sentiment. But where the optimism mostly ends. Over the weekend, top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said U.S. coronavirus deaths alone could reach 200,000, prompting President Donald Trump to extend nationwide social-distancing recommendations until April 30.

He worked in public relations for pharmaceutical giant Pfizer International before moving on to writing documentary films for the U.S. military. When the country became embroiled in the Vietnam War, Gaddis quit and became a freelancer, primarily writing copy for in-house industrial films and speeches for Eastman Kodak. In the late 1960s, he began working on the novel that would become J R . To help create the sense of total immersion in the chaos that is Wall Street, Gaddis employed a unique prose style that lends J R an inimitable charm. The novel consists of about ninety-nine percent spoken dialogue, all written in a manner that captures the tics and quirks of real life speech.

Lee Konstantinou, writing for The Los Angeles Review of Books , sums up the situation thus Both publishing and $T$ Gaddis's novel suggests, are paper empires,' enterprises heinously, hilariously bad at what they do, and bad in similar ways. Both have subordinated their alleged functions rationally allocating capital optimally connecting readers and writers to reckless speculation. Con men and gamblers rise, while the sensible and the serious are crushed. If Gaddis's indictment is right, his novels may therefore be paradoxically doomed to be ignored, derided, and misunderstood, to fail to find the readership they deserve, not despite but because of their integrity.

Gaddis's novel would thus be both the great chronicler of $T$ malignant rise and the victim of its triumphant ethos. Despite the unmitigated global disasters brought about by J R Corp's transgressions, its young founder isn't portrayed as any sort of villain. J R represents the misguided youth of America told from birth to aspire to untold heights of wealth and material acquisition.

With oil recently below $T$ per barrel and natural gas recently below $T$.80 per MMBtu, and still no light at the end of the tunnel, CHK could face some ugly results for Q1 2020, and possibly for another few quarters. The company's $9.5 billion in total debt is problematic, too.

But at $T$ per barrel, it simply doesn't make sense to give Transocean a call. For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2019, the company brought in $792 million in revenues - better than the $748 million in sales it registered in the year-ago quarter, but a far cry from the $3 billion-plus quarterly revenues it earned during peak oil. Utilization rates did rise a bit, but the total number of rigs in Transocean's fleet continues to drop. Several of its deepwater-drilling rigs are sitting idle if oil prices remain depressed, it's unlikely these rigs will be utilized anytime soon. Debt, which as you'll see, is problematic for a number of oil stocks, is a real concern at Transocean. It has $8.7 billion in long-term IOUs, with $4.3 billion of that set to mature by 2024. It needs every rig in its fleet working and churning out as much cash as possible to pay that off.

Pittsburgh-based natural gas firm CNX Resources formerly operated as Consol Energy before spinning off its coal business in November 2017. That coal business retained the Consol Energy -LRB-  CEIX  -RRB- name, while the natural gas business was renamed CNX.

Why were the $T$ companies broken apart Cheap and abundant natural gas, as well as a focus on lower carbon emissions, has basically driven coal to the brink of extinction. The split was meant to unlock value in the natural gas side of the business. However, CNX has spent most of its time post-spinoff trending lower, and it has been particularly hard-hit of late as natural gas prices have sunk into the ground.
2
-1
CNX already lowered its full-year 2020 estimates for natural gas prices in the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, from $T$0 per MMBtu to $T$.$T$. At that number, it expected organic free cash flow to hit $200 million, but natural gas has plumbed far lower levels since then. Meanwhile, CNX's fully burdened cash costs of production had jumped nearly 11 year-over-year.
2
-1
If there's any good news, it's that CNX's total debt of $T$.9 billion is far less than the oil and gas stocks we've discussed so far. But while CNX might not be headed toward bankruptcy, it appears extremely risky given the current cost of natural gas and no discernable end in sight to the commodity's weakness.

The oil and gas producer originally planned to spend $2.65 billion to fund its drilling program, but that has been hacked down to $1.2 billion. Average rig count in the Bakken will slump from nine to just three. Overall production is expected to decline 5 year-over-year.

$T$ stands to be in worse shape with oil now closer to $20 per barrel. CLR shareholders have been getting used to excess cash flows. With oil in the $50s, the low-cost Bakken producer was generating a decent amount of cash - cash that was used to reduce debt, buy back stock and even initiate a dividend in 2019.

But being cash flow-neutral -LRB- and having just $39.4 million in the bank -RRB- means that $T$ likely will have to raise cash from asset sales or debt if it wants to keep those dividends and buybacks flowing. Considering CLR already has $5.3 billion in debt - including about $1.1 billion in senior notes due in 2022 - it's clear the company is between a rock and a hard place.

European countries tended to respond less effectively, with Italy and Spain having $T$ of the worst outbreaks and the U.K. dithering over its strategy while wasting crucial time. But perhaps no advanced nation has responded as poorly as the U.S. Perverse regulation, a bungled government test and fragmented supply chains held back testing for crucial weeks, allowing the epidemic to spread undetected. Abdication of leadership by the federal government left the job of shutdowns to state and local governments.

In the first $T$ cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same. Combining Scholar Education Group's Debt And Its 17 Return On Equity Although Scholar Education Group does use debt, its debt to equity ratio of 0.11 is still low. The combination of modest debt and a very respectable ROE suggests this is a business worth watching. Careful use of debt to boost returns is often very good for shareholders.

It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets. What Does Return On Equity Signify Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business -LRB- plus any capital injections -RRB-.

That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares -LRB- equity -RRB-, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow.

While the doubling of infections has slowed from every two days to every six, the number of people who had to be moved into intensive care with intubation surged in one day, the governor said at a briefing in Manhattan. New York added almost 7,000 confirmed infections overnight, for a total of more than 66,000, Cuomo said. Of those, roughly 9,500 are hospitalized, an increase of more than 1,000, and about 2,350 were in intensive care, up 315. France reported 418 deaths in hospitals, the most in a day for the country. The number include deaths in other locations, and will add those figures later in the week, according to the health press office. The jump brings the total number of hospital deaths to 3,024.

This has been mirrored by many $T$ indices worldwide. But these are not normal times. There is not a single aspect of our day to day lives that would be recognizable to us if we're looking from our recent past almost anywhere in the world. And this fact appears to have been overlooked. You see, whilst stocks are of big, faceless corporations, they are more than just a ticker acronym on a screen. They are made up of people working within established parameters and systems. Those employees, from the lowest levels to the top, make these corporations run and make the wheels of production turn. Remove them, and, to one extent or another, those wheels stop turning. There are some companies that have already adapted to allow remote working in a way that would not have been possible even five years ago, but even they are not immune. All companies need customers, and those customers, in most cases, aren't being customers right now.

This will allow, in theory, every person to cover their bills while they sit at home and wait for it all to blow over. Of course, in practice, this is not so easy to deliver as each government has found when grappling with what is fair, how to reach self-employed people and which groups should get extra support or be completely exempt. Put it this way if this was a project that someone had proposed as a contingency plan to an economic group like the G8 so they could prepare for such an eventuality, it would be something that would take years, if not decades, to agree. Most governments came up with a working solution in days. It's never going to be perfect.

The Bank of China is in discussions to lower the interest rate banks pay on deposits for the first time since 2015 and a decision could be announced within days, the Financial Times reported last week, citing people familiar with the deliberations. A reduction would shore up banks profitability, buying lenders breathing room as authorities lean on them to support companies that are struggling to stay afloat after a shutdown that affected two-thirds of the economy.

Third, by over-predicting looming mass automation, we run the risk of missing the fundamental reality that those workers most vulnerable in the future are the same workers facing the greatest hardship today. Low-paid service sector workers, gig workers and temporary workers may not be at risk of automation, but rightfully demand workforce interventions ranging from accessible and affordable training to worker insurance to help mitigate the risk of temporary work.

She also said the results of several U.S. Treasury auctions that took place on Monday showed investors were seeking to buy more short-term treasuries even as the government increased the supply of them. There are a ton of bills and people still want more, because next to cash it's the most liquid thing you can purchase, Rupert said. Jim Barnes, director of fixed income at Bryn Mawr Trust, pointed to several positive technical signs helping support yields, including relatively strong liquidity measures, and said that few investors seem to be needing to use emergency Fed facilities like additional repurchase agreement .

$T$ director of fixed income at Bryn Mawr Trust, said Monday's trading seemed to reflect that news as well as rising stock markets, a traditional dynamic that seemed paused during earlier points of trading. It does seem like there is more optimism, he said. U.S. stocks rose on Monday, led in part by healthcare shares. Still, the results of several short-term Treasury auctions earlier in the day showed investors continue to worry about the pandemic and whether governments are responding appropriately, said Kim Rupert, senior economist for Action Economics. There are a ton of bills and people still want more, because next to cash it's the most liquid thing you can purchase, Rupert said. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down 3.1 basis points at 0.23 in afternoon trading.

Tasks that normally would take weeks or months have been completed in days. The companies expect production to begin in three weeks and the first ventilators to ship before the end of April. On March 19, GM began collaborating with Ventec, which normally makes about 200 machines a month, to figure out how to make about 10 times as many in that time.

The $T$ wrote an opinion essay on March 18 in The New York Times calling on corporate executives to join the fight against the pandemic.

Some $T$ corporate executives have signed a letter pledging to help in response to their plea. The four people familiar with the call said that Barra offered to help and the representative from Stop the Spread suggested the company ought to use its manufacturing and purchasing might to help Ventec scale up ventilator production. Ventec isn't a giant in the ventilator industry, but it is known for its VOCSN model, which received FDA approval in 2017. The VOCSN, which is the size of a large toaster oven, combines a number of functions that had previously been performed by several machines to pump air into the lungs, suction out secretions and produce oxygen when a central oxygen line is not available. The device is used in critical-care hospital units but also can be used for home care. Around the time of the call, GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler were grappling with whether to keep their plants running. The United Auto Workers union was putting pressure on the companies to do more to protect workers.

The day after Barra spoke to Stop the Spread, GM and the other $T$ large US automakers said they would shut down plants to until at least March 30. The following day, Phil Kienle, GM's head of manufacturing for North America, and a few other executives flew to Ventec's headquarters in Bothell, Washington.

The group concluded that with GM's resources, $T$000 a month would be possible, four people familiar with the talks said. The next day, GM emailed its suppliers specifications of Ventec parts, asking if any could produce them in high volumes. Kienle's team quickly zeroed in on Kokomo as a location to assemble the machines, a person familiar with the matter said. The plant, unlike much grittier car assembly factories, has the type of clean room needed for making medical devices.

On the evening of Sunday, March $T$ GM's purchasing chief, Shilpan Amin, emailed Barr and other top executives to let them know that the company and Ventec had secured commitments from suppliers to produce 95 of the needed parts, according to three people familiar with the email. By last Tuesday, GM and Ventec had the details of their collaboration hammered out, which they discussed publicly early in the week. GM would operate as a contract manufacturer for Ventec, which would sell and distribute the machines. Ventec also plans to increase production at its plant in Washington state. As talks progressed, coronavirus cases were soaring in New York City, and climbing as well in Boston, Detroit, New Orleans and elsewhere. In a news conference, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York complained that the federal government had provided only 400 ventilators to the state.

You pick the $T$000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators, Cuomo said last Tuesday. Two days later, Trump disputed the governor's numbers while calling in to Sean Hannity's show on Fox News. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators, Trump said.

The $T$ and its partner, Ventec, had spent more than a week figuring out how to make thousands of the lifesaving devices when the White House said GM was wasting While much of the US economy has ground to a halt because of the coronavirus outbreak, several dozen workers in orange vests and hard hats were hauling heavy equipment Sunday at a General Motors plant in Kokomo, Indiana. The crew was part of a crash effort to make tens of thousands of ventilators, the lifesaving machines that keep critically ill patients breathing. The machines are in desperate demand as hospitals face the prospect of dire shortages. New York state alone may need 30,000 or more. President Donald Trump on Friday accused GM and its chief executive, Mary T. Barra, of dragging their feet on the project and directed his administration to force the company to make ventilators under a 1950s law.

Even if the federal $T$ ultimately declines to buy the machines Ventec and GM make, the companies are moving ahead because they know there will be other customers around the country, and across the world, four people familiar with their plans said. But Trump's Twitter posts appear to have unnerved other corporate leaders. A person familiar with the Stop the Spread campaign said that several corporate executives who had been willing to contribute to the effort earlier had backed away for fear of ending up becoming targets for Trump as Barra had. At a White House news conference on Sunday, the president struck a different tone. General Motors is doing a fantastic job, Trump said. I don't think we have to worry about General Motors now.

The day after Barra spoke to Stop the Spread, GM and the other two large US automakers said they would shut down $T$ to until at least March 30. The following day, Phil Kienle, GM's head of manufacturing for North America, and a few other executives flew to Ventec's headquarters in Bothell, Washington. Early on Friday, March 20, the GM team sat down with Ventec executives to learn how the ventilators are made, and what parts are required. Ventec had already started a push to ramp up production to 1,000 a month. The group concluded that with GM's resources, 20,000 a month would be possible, four people familiar with the talks said. The next day, GM emailed its suppliers specifications of Ventec parts, asking if any could produce them in high volumes. Kienle's team quickly zeroed in on Kokomo as a location to assemble the machines, a person familiar with the matter said.

On the evening of Sunday, March 22, GM's purchasing chief, Shilpan Amin, emailed Barr and other top executives to let them know that the company and Ventec had secured commitments from suppliers to produce 95 of the needed parts, according to three people familiar with the email. By last Tuesday, GM and Ventec had the details of their collaboration hammered out, which they discussed publicly early in the week. GM would operate as a contract manufacturer for Ventec, which would sell and distribute the machines.

As talks progressed, $T$ cases were soaring in New York City, and climbing as well in Boston, Detroit, New Orleans and elsewhere. In a news conference, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York complained that the federal government had provided only 400 ventilators to the state. You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators, Cuomo said last Tuesday. Two days later, Trump disputed the governor's numbers while calling in to Sean Hannity's show on Fox News. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators, Trump said. You go into major hospitals sometimes, and they'll have two ventilators. The federal government hasn't indicated how many machines the ventilator makers, including GM and Ventec, ought to produce, two people familiar with the talks said. Ventec never received a confirmation from the government about which machine it was interested in acquiring, how many it wanted and how much it was willing to spend.

On Friday, he said on Twitter that $T$ and GM had promised to provide 40,000 ventilators very quickly but was now telling the administration that it could produce only 6,000 by late April and wanted top dollar for the machines. Always a mess with Mary B, he said. GM wasn't negotiating price and other details with the government. Ventec has led the talks with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services about how many ventilators the government would like to buy, and at what price. The automaker has said it will not make a profit on the ventilators it assembles and is only seeking to cover its costs. GM's involvement in ventilators began with a phone call asking for help.

The four people familiar with the call said that $T$ offered to help and the representative from Stop the Spread suggested the company ought to use its manufacturing and purchasing might to help Ventec scale up ventilator production. Ventec isn't a giant in the ventilator industry, but it is known for its VOCSN model, which received FDA approval in 2017. The VOCSN, which is the size of a large toaster oven, combines a number of functions that had previously been performed by several machines to pump air into the lungs, suction out secretions and produce oxygen when a central oxygen line is not available. The device is used in critical-care hospital units but also can be used for home care. Around the time of the call, GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler were grappling with whether to keep their plants running. The United Auto Workers union was putting pressure on the companies to do more to protect workers.

He expects it to do the same thing once the $T$ crisis had abated. The extent to which the child care market is strong very much depends on the strength and the health of the broader labor market, he said. Pine Village -- which enrolls about 500 children -- collect tuition for the month of April. Instead, it opted to ask for donations from parents that would go directly to furloughed staff, who are still receiving benefits but being paid. We decided that we needed to do our part as an organization to keep our staff healthy and our children and parents healthy, said Emma LaVecchia, Pine co-founder. It was a really difficult decision, but we were totally confident that it was the right one to make. Child care providers run on razor thin margins, and workers make on average $11.83 an hour -- less than retail employees, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. A 2015 report by the Economic Policy Institute found that one in seven child care workers live in families below the federal poverty line.

The promise that electric vehicles -LRB- EVs -RRB- hold in the automobile market hinges on $T$ major factors that they will decrease tailpipe emissions and. they will be more economical to operate than internal combustion engine -LRB- ICE -RRB- vehicles. But as oil prices continue to stay close to a several-decade record low, the cost of operating an ICE vehicle has not been this inexpensive in recent years, making them look a lot more attractive to prospective buyers. With analysts lowering their outlook for global oil demand in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 epidemic, it is certain that the operating cost of ICE vehicles will be comparable to that of EVs. The memo looks to have reached major U.S. auto companies, with detailed production plans for North America showing Ford Motor Company -LRB- NYSE F  -RRB- and General Motors Company -LRB- NYSE GM  -RRB- forecasting to produce more than five million SUVs and pickup trucks in 2026, while only planning to make 320,000 EVs the same year.

These paltry EV numbers are nowhere close to holding up to the big $T$ often reiterated idea of an electrified auto future. To put numbers in perspective, the production volume is only about 5 of the companies' total vehicle production in North America that year. In comparison, EV market leader Tesla Inc. -LRB- NYSE TLSA  -RRB- manufactured more cars in 2019 at its Fremont, California factory than Ford and GM plan for 2026. And even with these minuscule numbers, the EVs being produced in the U.S. by Ford and GM will mostly be exported to China, where the demand for EVs has far outstripped the rest of the world. Thus, it is puzzling to see the auto giants publicly take a stance that looks quite different from their reality and proposed future. Executives across both Ford and GM have frequently expressed faith in a future inching towards an all-electric zero-emissions transport environment.

The passage of the Cares Act was a step $T$ in expanding benefits to these workers in the current crisis. The United States is already on the lower end of the benefit spectrum among developed countries. The rationale is partially to keep costs low, but it is also to reduce what economists call moral hazard, the idea that people will not want to work unless they are incentivized to find a job due to economic hardship associated with unemployment. But when used as a justification for stinginess in social programs, moral hazard often fails to appreciate the crucial role payments play in maintaining aggregate economic activity and household financial security. Low-wage workers spend more of their income rather than saving it, known as their marginal propensity to consume, so increasing their take-home pay has a multiplier effect in the economy, generating more economic activity. Paying lower-wage workers less just keeps them from spending.

The Cares Act increased unemployment insurance, providing total income replacement for the average $T$ who loses a job due to the mandatory public-health measures being instituted across the country. This aspect of the legislation calls into question the conventional economic wisdom about minimizing unemployment payments to incentivize work, especially during a crisis. Never before has the replacement rate for unemployment insurance matched prior earnings, nor has it applied to so many workers. Typically, workers receive less than half their prior earnings when collecting unemployment insurance. A progressive lower earners receive more generous benefits relative to their prior lower-wage workers closer to two-thirds of their prior earnings.

$T$ is cutting larger unemployment checks and sending them to more good news. The bad news is that the length and depth of this crisis remains unknown. A one-time, four-month fix is unlikely to be enough. We need to institute automatic triggers, for instance by using the Sahm Rule, which follows changes in the unemployment rate to automatically increase federal funding for unemployment insurance. That measure was included in an unemployment-benefits proposal by Sen. Michael Bennet that make it into the final act.

For the current year, weekly changes in sight deposits have seen a major surge - and this was even before most of the current coronavirus chaos began pressuring markets. These activities have already eclipsed the upward trends in the SNB's weekly sight deposits that were visible in 2019, so there is not much here which suggests long-term trends are anywhere near finished. If anything, these actions are only going to continue rising now that fundamental uncertainties have taken over the global economy, and these are not events that are likely to provide bullish support for the market's FXF valuations.

From a central banker's perspective, this would provide more liquidity to the system but it would also put significant downside pressure on the value on franc-denominated assets. In the last few weeks, central banks have already enacted historic measures in order to calm market sentiment and so there is very little stopping the SNB from implementing further policy measures -LRB- and further weakening rebound prospects for FXF in the process -RRB-.

As a result, it looks as though markets have relatively little interest in establishing trends that work in opposition to the actions of the $T$ This makes sense because it can be argued that this is a losing battle that groups of individual investors can't reasonably hope to overcome.

Trends from January 2020 were positive in roughly equal measure -LRB- with inflows of $9.51 million for the period -RRB- but followed a bearish period in December 2019, where outflows of $9.35 million were recorded.

In this case what has been done is the deliberate lockdown of the economy to prevent the health crisis worsening. And this is an unknown territory for any policymaker.

And checks or bank transfers shut out the unbanked. That leaves a gap for a new institution to step in, like a central bank, which could issue a digital currency as an efficient way of delivering a universal basic income.

It's from the Rockefeller Institute's Liz Farmer, published nationally and in Crain's Chicago Business That idea is for state and local $T$ to issue bonds to borrow money for pensions. They are called pension obligation bonds, or POBs, which we have criticized repeatedly at Wirepoints. And the proposal is to make those bonds tax-exempt, meaning federal taxpayers would subsidize them. First, POBs are inherently foolish. They represent nothing more than borrowing to cover debt one credit card to another replacing unfunded pension debt with unfunded bond debt. They are a can-kicking at its purest. Worse, they gamble that interest paid on the bond will be less than earnings made on the stocks a pension would buy with the borrowed money.

Data firm OAG said the aviation industry was less than half the size it was in mid-January, just before countries started confirming coronavirus cases outside China. Aside from heavy maintenance needs on the A330-300s and some of the 737s, American was also facing retrofitting costs on some of the 737s.

It said on Monday it would be seeking up to $T$ billion from a government aid package meant to help airlines manage costs during the downturn, particularly for employee payroll. The pace of aircraft retirements influences an airline's cost structure since new aircraft are costly to buy but cheaper to run. It also gives a clue to potential future demand for new aircraft. Some analysts are predicting a surplus of aircraft as a wounded airline industry emerges from the coronavirus lockdown into what many economists expect to be a broad recession. But decisions by airlines to retire planes in 2020 and 2021 could trim that surplus, Ascend by Cirium consultancy head Rob Morris told an Airline Economics webinar on Friday.

Trump had said he would like to see the economy reopen by Easter, which is April $T$ a move that was opposed by health experts. I do think he got mugged by reality, said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. It may relieve some of the pressure, and I guess the friction, between those who are focused on the health side, who say we have to shut down for a while, and those who want to balance the economic recovery with the health need. We bought ourselves some mental time about not rushing back too soon. Boockvar said announcement that it could quickly start rolling out the test kits was also a psychological positive. One of the clear aspects of getting it under control is testing, and separating the healthy from the sick, said Boockvar. Availability of testing has been an issue, and the U.S. has lagged some other countries in its ability to test.

According to Johns Hopkins, the number of cases in the U.S. grew above 140,000 and deaths topped $T$500. The New York area remains the biggest hot spot, but Louisiana and Michigan also reported higher concentrations of the illness. Shutting down the economy, by keeping people in their homes and out of crowds and work places, is viewed as the most effective way of stopping the spread of the disease. The fact is getting that April 30 deadline out there is what everyone was thinking about, said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG. It struck the ideal balance between medicine and economics. From the financial markets point of view, you have an entire month to continue to look at data about what may or may not happen. Trump struck the right balance. The market like surprises. The market got something from him last night that was completely consistent with what expectations were. That in itself is a market calming factor. What going to be looking for is a volatility calming factor.

It was above $T$600 at midday. A lot of the good news about been done and what can be done about setting expectations has been out. In the next few weeks, what going to see is the numbers start to climb, said Emanuel. From a market standpoint and a financial standpoint, everything is on the table and now the market is just subject to the ebb and flow of news which, in our view, makes it likely you get some sort of retest of the lows. Markets are focused on a debate about whether the U.S. economy can quickly shake off the impact of the shutdown or not. While some economists expect a big V shaped bounce back in the third quarter, after a steep second quarter contraction, others see a slower recovery, more like a U shape.

Ward McCarthy, Jefferies chief financial economist, said the coronavirus has created a unique strain for the economy, and positive to have the $T$ administration aligned with scientists. We have never before been in a situation where the government has mandated a shutdown of a wide swath of economic activity, and then at the same time, tried to offset the shut down it caused, McCarthy said. The short term costs of the shut down are huge, but the benefits to the public health are huge. In the long term, the smarter thing to do is to be overly cautions on the public health side. The economy will come back. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, were lower Monday. The bond market is pricing in lower growth and lower inflation, said Jon Hill, senior rate strategist at BMO.

European plane maker Airbus, Arrow Electronics, BAE Systems, GKN Aerospace, Meggitt, Rolls-Royce, Siemens, Smiths Group, and Thales are all part of a consortium that on Monday was awarded a contract by the UK government to produce10,000 $T$ ventilators for coronavirus patients. The grouping, named VentilatorChallengeUK , was formed recently in response to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's calls for the country's businesses to step in and help meet rising demand for life-saving equipment. In contrast to the U.S., where President Donald Trump on Friday officially invoked the Defense Production Act to force General Motors to manufacture thousands of ventilators, most of the projects involving the aerospace sector in Europe are born from the industry's own initiatives.

The $T$ regulator has been involved throughout and is expected to quickly sign off on an agreed new design after the final audit, according to VentilatorChallengeUK The consortium is now working to start production of this design, which is based on existing technologies and can be assembled from materials and parts in current production.

In parallel, the group will provide another producer of $T$ ventilators with additional manufacturing support and assembly facilities in order to scale up production of a second existing ventilator design which has full regulatory approval. PROMOTED GKN, whose technologies are used in business jets, single-aisle and widebody aircraft and fifth-generation fighter aircraft, will establish a new assembly plant and Rolls-Royce will set up a supply chain to feed in materials as quickly as possible. The engine maker's team dedicated to the ventilator project includes controls, valve and pump specialists who normally work in its Controls business in Solihull, near Birmingham, and commercial, procurement and programme management specialists usually based in its Derby campus. Rolls-Royce said is expects the team to grow significantly in the coming days and are also using resources in the U.S., so that we can work around the clock.

In Germany, the Deutsches Zentrum Luft- und Raumfahrt -LRB- DLR -RRB- said Monday it has successfully tested the conversion of its 3D printers so the models can now manufacture $T$ protective equipment during the Coronavirus crisis.

The retrofit was prompted by a request from the European Commission for assistance in the production of urgently needed $T$ equipment, specifically the production of protective masks and valves for respirators using 3D printing. DLR said is currently assessing its 3D printer capabilities, noting that the performance varies depending on the type of printer. Its most powerful printers can produce up to 10 protective masks or 15 valves for ventilators per day but by networking institutes and facilities, it will be possible to produce larger quantities.

The new challenge is that with the vast unemployment and pay reductions of 2020, consumers will be stretched to buy more than one or $T$ streaming services with the probable leaders being of course Netflix and Disney. Also, movie goers won't be quick to sit in crowded theaters for quite a while after they are reopened. Then there remains the balance sheet debt, which is still mountainous at more than $160 billion after the company already disposed of maybe $30 billion of high quality assets in attempting to flatten the mountain.

To resolve these issues, it's quite conceivable that within $T$ to five years T will, with disappointment and disgust, attempt to spin out the Warner Media assets so happily acquired in 2018.

It competed directly with Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile and the various mso cable companies including Comcast and Charter But that was before the company went, as they say, Hollywood in buying satellite provider DirecTV for a premium price of $49 billion right at the start of cord-cutting and then followed in 2018 by spending $81 billion to buy Time Warner just as its crown jewel HBO performance was peaking with the popularity of shows such as Game of Thrones.

Verizon made its own blunders buying the scraps of Yahoo and AOL for a combined $10 billion or so and then within 3 years having to write them down by half.

$T$ Phone will of course do everything possible to maintain the current dividend of $0.52 a quarter, but that will under the circumstances be challenging. And if and when should such a cut occur the repercussions will be felt most severely by the massive number of pensioners and the many pension plans that depend on the high yield. Even a hint of a cut would be seismic, and likely end up rattling confidence in the overall stock market too. Meanwhile, valuing T shares is a wild guessing game given that its strategies and recent acquisitions have resulted in a very muddled profile No one can at this point clearly identify the growth potential of any of its parts.

It thus wouldn't be surprising if within the next few years Big Phone spins out its recent entertainment and media investments. For investors the first question is about what business is T in and how is this patchwork to be valued. The answer is not as highly as in the past in terms of or cash flow multiples or price to book value.

By Huw JonesLONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United States has given banks a two-year break from provisions for loans soured by the $T$ pandemic, seeking to keep credit flowing while borrowers struggle to stay afloat as economic activity grinds to a halt. Europe, meanwhile, is taking a less accommodating stance as the authorities on opposite sides of the Atlantic follow different paths, in contrast with the close global cooperation aimed at rebuilding resilience in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago.

The following explains the rules banks are governed by when it comes to accounting for losses and how they are being amended temporarily to ride out the $T$ crisis. HOW DID WE GET HERE In the run up to the financial crisis banks did not provision for loans until a repayment was missed or a borrower defaulted - far too late to raise capital in market meltdowns. Taxpayers ended up bailing out lenders, prompting world leaders to call for reforms that require banks to provision for potential losses when a loan is first made, long before any problems emerge.

The IASB, regulators and central banks in Europe have so far stuck with the IFRS 9 rule and merely asked banks to be flexible when $T$ comes to calculating provisions. The financial shock from the pandemic should be viewed as temporary, they say, pointing to other measures being implemented. Regulators are granting loan repayment holidays and allowing banks to use some of their capital buffers, while governments are pumping billions of euros into economies and offering loan guarantees. This all cuts down on provisioning, European regulators have said, though IFRS 9 remains in force. European banking officials say the EU guidance on IFRS 9 remains conceptual while U.S. authorities have been blunter and more forceful.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking on CBS' Face the Nation talk show, also said the $T$ could take equity positions in return for infusions of taxpayer money. As the president said, we'll look at each one of these situations, he said. Some of them are very good companies that just need liquidity and will get loans. Some of these companies may need more significant help and we may be taking warrants or equity as well as that. The president wants to make sure the American taxpayers are compensated. Mnuchin said any such transactions would take the form of warrants, a type of security that gives its holder the right to buy or sell an asset at a certain price up to a certain date determined when it is emitted. Warrants can thus be converted into shares. The massive financial rescue plan passed by the US Congress designates $50 billion for the airline industry.

Recall from above that over the past decade ROL has grown revenue by 6.56 annually and EPS by 9.68 annually. Those are very healthy numbers to be sure. But in my opinion, that isn't nearly high enough to warrant a 5-year average ratio of 50. I invite you to think of a few companies that epitomize growth.

Yet ROL, who is not in a high growth sector and doesn't even nearly have the same impressive growth record nor as bright of prospects for future growth, is trading at an earnings multiple that is head and shoulders above Google and Apple. How can this be Well, at least part of the picture is that ROL has tremendous levels of insider ownership. Their executives and directors hold a whopping 57 of shares outstanding. This puts quite the floor under the stock price. Immense selling pressure can never take hold when more than half of shares never budge. Some may consider this a good thing, a safety net of sorts that will help their investment not go down, or fluctuate at all for that matter.

Some may consider this a good thing, a $T$ net of sorts that will help their investment not go down, or fluctuate at all for that matter. This is borne out in the beta figure for ROL, which is only .27. If you are looking for capital preservation or a steady pillar against market gyrations, perhaps ROL fits your criteria. For me however, I see this as a negative. It means that you will always pay a fantastic premium for ownership of ROL. At least as long as insiders hold on to their controlling stake. It means that executives and directors will always get their way when it comes to corporate decisions. What's more, if insiders ever do decide to cash in, the stock price is going to go down severely on fat volume.

$T$ there should be no fundamental reason for Mosaic to trade at a discount to its book value given its position in the cost curve.

Global lockdown is impacting the company's operations at three facilities Miski Mayo $T$ Peru, distribution operations $T$ and Patrocinio Mine $T$ Brazil. Miski Mayo and Patrocinio are production side issues while Indian lockdown had created a demand side problem with fertilizer shops shut after initial announcement.

$T$ was expected to account for 13 of global phosphate consumption and 5 of global potash consumption $T$ 2020 -LRB- Source slide 32 and 36 of February investor update  -RRB- and shutdown of fertilizer shops $T$ the country would have created a big demand slowdown.

However, shutting down agriculture related activities would have led to a much bigger problem than Covid-19 $T$ a country of 1.3 billion It took government four days to realize it -LRB- which isn't much by Indian standards -RRB- and on Friday the union minister of agriculture -LRB- equivalent to secretary of agriculture -RRB- issued a notification exempting all agriculture related activities including fertilizer shops from lockdown. He also gave an instruction to states to make sure this notification is strictly followed.

While bears are $T$ firm grip and the market is filled with expectations of supply and demand shock due to coronavirus, I don't think these issues can go on for more than a few weeks.
India

$T$ swift reversal is an example of why any impact on agriculture related activity can't continue for long. If we look at the recent comments from Brazil's president, I don't think shutdown can continue for long. Peru should also open on April 12 given their relatively low exposure.

However, even if the lockdown was to continue $T$ these countries, fertilizers will likely be exempted. Patrocinio mine isn't a big problem as it produced only 0.4 mn tonnes phosphate rock last year. However, Miski Mayo with 4 mn tonnes of production -LRB- out of which 3 mn is Mosaic's proportionate share -RRB- is likely to cause some headwind.
India

In 2017 there was a flood which disrupted supply from Miski Mayo $T$ late March and early April. According to my estimates, the company incurred $7mn to $8mn cost headwind because of that.

I believe the current situation is similar to the disruptions $T$ 2017.

Mosaic has acquired Vale's VALE  -RRB- stake $T$ Miski Mayo since then and has increased its share from 30 to So, I believe the total impact will be approximately 2.5x of what it saw $T$ 2017 or $20 mn.

This is manageable if the company its annual dividend of $0.20 per share which equates to $75mn $T$ annual cash outflow -LRB- 378 mn share count at the end of last year -RRB-. Fertilizer stock have corrected along with the broader market.

Mosaic is down 42 $T$ the last one month while Nutrien NTR  -RRB- and CF Industries CF  -RRB- are both down Nutrien is trading at 1.66x tangible book value while CF is trading at 1.68x tangible book value. Mosaic is the cheapest trading at less than half of its tangible book value. According to the company's latest 10-K filing its book value and tangible book value were $24.73 per share and $21.67 per share respectively. The stock price on Friday's close was $9.90.

Mosaic is a relatively low cost producer and it comes $T$ the bottom half to one-third $T$ terms of cash cost of production -LRB- Source slide 31 and 44 of investor presentation  -RRB-. Before economics stop making sense for Mosaic and its investments and book values are written off, more than half of other producers -LRB- with higher cost of production than Mosaic -RRB- will suffer the same fate.
India
-1
This means taking out half the capacity from the markets which $T$ turn will make economics much better for Mosaic and the other remaining players.
India

So, there should be no fundamental reason for Mosaic to trade at a discount to its book value given its position $T$ the cost curve. If we were talking about a company levered to oil, I could have understood it trading at a discount to its tangible book value.
India

There is a secular shift towards renewable which might impact crude oil demand $T$ the long term.

Fertilizer, on the other hand, is a commodity which is likely to see a continued growth $T$ the foreseeable future as the world solves its hunger problem and the quality of diet -LRB- amount of protein $T$ diet -RRB- improves $T$ countries. The competitors are also behaving rationally and there were production cuts last year due to low prices. The company is also not making losses on an annual basis -LRB- excluding impairments of goodwill -RRB-.

If you're too aggressive, being more $T$ will reduce your losses if the market continues to fall. The easiest way to diversify is with an asset allocation fund like a balanced or target date fund. These are designed to be a one-stop shop so you only need one. If you prefer to create your own portfolio, you can take this risk tolerance questionnaire and follow the guidelines. Even if your portfolio was originally properly diversified, the recent declines in the market have likely caused it to be out of balance.

Member economist $T$ of Frankfurt's Goethe University said that the downturn would be deeper but not longer than the recession following the global financial crisis a decade ago with a steep fall over the first six months followed by recovery. It is not like a war where the capital stock has been destroyed, meaning many businesses could quickly resume operations, he said, conceding that the uncertainty is immense. The report's alternative, more pessimistic scenarios include a deeper slump of 5.4 this year. Another scenario that assumes restrictive measures remain in place past the summer implies a slower recovery with a dip of 4.5 this year but only a 1.0 rebound in 2021. The council's report contrasts with a more pessimistic estimate from Munich's Ifo institute of a fall in output of 7.2 to 11.2 this year. The German economy shrank 5.7 in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis and the Great Recession but rebounded the year after.

The report's alternative, more pessimistic scenarios include a deeper slump of 5.4 this year. Another scenario that assumes restrictive measures remain in place past the summer implies a slower recovery with a dip of 4.5 this year but only a 1.0 rebound in 2021. The council's report contrasts with a more pessimistic estimate from Munich's Ifo institute of a fall in output of 7.2 to 11.2 this year. The German economy shrank 5.7 in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis and the Great Recession but rebounded the year after.

And if an economy shrinks by 15 or $T$ in a single quarter which looks eminently plausible for the US and Western Europe then it is going to need a lot less oil. Related happening to supply requires a bit more of an explanation, because with demand collapsing the normal response of the big producers would be to limit output in the hope that would stabilise the price. This time it is different. Saudi Arabia has responded by turning the taps full on even though its own government finances will suffer from a lower oil price.

With Donald Trump accepting the need to keep tough Covid-19, it is clear that the crisis is going to last for longer than originally expected. It be long before storage capacity runs out. The current weakness of oil prices will not last for ever. Supply will go down as a result of US shale producers going out of business and an eventual deal between Riyadh and Moscow.

The cost of Brent crude one of the market benchmarks , the lowest it has been since the $T$ and the UK were making preparations for the invasion of Iraq in November 2002. The fall in demand is easy enough to explain. Planes have been grounded and factories mothballed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. People are working from home and so using their cars less. Developed economies have become more service-sector dominated than they were 40 years ago but they still consume a lot of crude.

Lloyds likely have the balance sheet strength to $T$ up for this shortfall either. In October it axed its share buyback programme in response to ballooning PPI-related financial penalties. The bank might have sailed through the worst of this particular saga, sure, but the fallout of the coronavirus tragedy threatens to cause even more chaos for its capital-building plans. As I said earlier though, Covid-19 the only thing Lloyds investors need to contend with. Brexit also casts a cloud over the bank and its ability to keep paying market-beating dividends.

The steady stream of disappointing trading data from across the banking sector is proof of this. But the economic turbulence caused by Brexit pales into insignificance compared to the damage that the coronavirus promises to wreak on Lloyds and its peers. Certainly in the near term. It threatens to rock the domestic economy like nothing any of us have likely seen in our lifetimes, as forecasts from the Centre for Economics and Business Research -LRB- CEBR -RRB- suggest. The body predicts that a 0.5 dip in national output in the first quarter of 2020 will worsen to a staggering 15 drop in the June quarter. This would represent the sharpest decline since 1997.

More than 100,000 American have been infected with $T$ while tens of millions more continue to shelter at home. Meanwhile, the markets are crashing. And yet the more things change, the more they stay the same. While health care workers and local governments frantically race against the clock to keep up with the escalating medical caseloads while trying to keep themselves and their families safe, Congress was still able to find the time to give money away to rich people.

Thanks to a stunning new report from the New York Times, which has been relentless on the tax beat during the $T$ administration, we've learned that a provision has been included in the 880-page coronavirus stimulus bill to help the very wealthy in a way that is breathtaking in its scope and detail. It is worth taking a minute -- many of us have more of those now in our quarantined states -- to explain. When individuals buy real estate, even if they do so using loans or other people's money, they can depreciate -- or write off, over time -- the cost of the physical property on their taxes. Suppose, for example, that a taxpayer bought a $2 million building as an investment. He would be able to deduct, or subtract from his taxes, something like $100,000 a year for 20 years to defray the costs of buying and improving the property. The taxpayer would be able to take these deductions even if the building were going up in value.

Back in 2009, amid a similarly frightening crisis, the U.S. discovered a novel way to restore clarity and confidence $T$ stress tests that showed how much the largest financial institutions stood to lose, and ensured they would get the resources they needed. a tool that the Trump administration and Congress should be preparing to apply again. The Federal Reserve conducts stress tests of the largest banks every year. It devises worst-case scenarios consisting of deep recessions and market routs, tallies the hypothetical losses and decides whether the banks are adequately prepared. But the scenarios for the latest round, already underway, were designed before the pandemic hit. Worse, the exercise has devolved into a formality that reflect what happens in a real crisis, and that banks tend to pass too easily. The 2009 version was very different. For one, the sheer severity of the ongoing global financial crisis dictated scenarios that bore some semblance to reality.

Yes, this entails explicitly allowing $T$ bailouts. And yes, to some extent this may involve rescuing institutions that acted irresponsibly by, for example, fueling a boom in corporate debt that has left many businesses unduly vulnerable to a downturn, and by failing to maintain enough equity capital to withstand the inevitable consequences. Lessons must be learned and acted upon.

Gross domestic product will decline by about 10 percent in the first three quarters of 2020 before a gradual recovery in the final three months, James McIntyre, $T$ economist at Bloomberg Economics, wrote in a research report Monday.
Australia

He expect $T$ to return to its pre-coronavirus level of activity for three years. The grim economic reality is that not all businesses and jobs will be able to be saved despite the best efforts of fiscal policy makers, McIntyre wrote. Fiscal measures are still essential, and worth it it is less expensive to assist firms and households through to an eventual recovery than to rebuild the economy after the fact. Prime Minister Scott Morrison pledged Monday to spend A$130 billion -LRB- $80 billion -RRB- over six months to try to safeguard jobs, in a third tranche of fiscal stimulus.
Australia

The Reserve Bank of $T$ has cut its cash rate to near-zero and is buying government bonds to lower yields and reduce interest rates across the economy. McIntyre argues that stimulus measures, no matter how big, prevent upheaval in the economy, but key to helping firms through the crisis and rebuilding afterward. Tens of thousands of Australian workers have already been sent home as retailers and airlines all-but close and queues outside job centers lengthen.

The Olympic Games, of which basketball is a part and potentially could be huge for Canada assuming the $T$ commitments it received earlier this year still hold, took a step in assuring that remains a strong possibility when the decision was made to retain pretty much the same schedule in 2021 for the Games that would have existed in 2020.

How much will it cost $T$ Why we picked the Toyota Prius The name Prius is synonymous with hybrid, and for good reason. best-selling hybrid continues to prioritize fuel economy above all else, and though efficiency is its main goal, the Prius ask buyers to make any major compromises except maybe in the styling department. The Prius is the most fuel-efficient hybrid around, getting an EPA-rated 56 mpg combined in Eco trim.

The Prius also achieves a very low drag coefficient of $T$ meaning it has fairly low aerodynamic drag, which helps improve efficiency. designers managed to do that while maintaining a roomy cabin and useful hatchback shape. The current-generation Prius is also appreciably sportier than previous models, thanks to changes like a lower center of gravity and a more sophisticated double-wishbone independent rear suspension system. Like other Toyota models, the Prius also gets the Toyota Safety Sense suite of driver-assistance features -LRB- including adaptive cruise control and a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection -RRB- as standard equipment. The Prius is still a fuel economy champ, but the current emphasis on sporty handling and technology make it a better all-around car than ever before.

Land Rover claims the P400e will do 0 to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds, and reach a top speed of 137 mph on pavement. But, as with other Range Rover variants, the P400e is set apart from other utility vehicles by genuine off-road capability. Land Rover promises the plug-in hybrid powertrain compromise off-road ability, and it even claims the all-electric mode allows for greater control at low speeds on slippery surfaces -LRB- on the road, Land Rover estimates 19 miles of all-electric range -RRB-.

So for me, this is a time to get in good shape out of the $T$ let my body heal and to come back, when the time is right, with a renewed sense of drive. Less than a week after deciding that the Olympics could not begin on their scheduled July 24 date because of the coronavirus pandemic, the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee decided to reschedule for July 2021 rather than an earlier date next spring.

Lincecum, Bob Gibson, Sandy Koufax and Jim Palmer are the only pitchers in MLB history with $T$ Cy Youngs, $T$ World Series titles and a no-hitter. That game will air tonight at 8 p.m. on NBC Sports Bay Area. You surely remember the 148 pitches, and you likely remember Hunter Pence's saving catch. But here are some things you might have forgotten about a special night at what was then jokingly known as Park South. Lincecum was simply different, and he never iced his arm as he was growing up and later establishing himself as one of the world's best pitchers. He didn't do it after 148 pitches, either. Nope, no ice, Lincecum said the next morning. Not even in the drinks I didn't have last night.

When you think back to the 2013 Giants, you might remember the phrase rock bottom. The reigning champs had a rough May and a long losing streak at the end of June, and when they got no-hit by Homer Bailey on the second night of July, Bruce Bochy threw his hands up in the visiting clubhouse and sighed. Hopefully this is rock bottom, he said quietly that night. You hope this is as low as it gets. That was not the low point for a team that would finish 10 games under.500.

For years, Payton, 56, has been one of the most compelling and engaging figures to talk to in NFL circles, largely because he has a way of wrapping his candor with wit and panache.

Our spring complex is being used as a coronavirus testing site until further notice, Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said Monday. So we're going to shut it down to all players and staff completely while the county and National Guard use it for testing. At first, spring training facilities were left open during the shutdown, but with more and more shelter-in-place orders, parking lots and stadiums are being re-purposed. The news of probably the week is that we've totally closed the facility here in West Palm Beach, Rizzo said. Scenarios like the one there are playing out all over the country.

TOKYO The $T$ Olympics will open next year in the same time slot scheduled for this year's games. The schedule for the games is key to preparing for the organizing committee president Yoshiro Mori said. This will only accelerate our progress. Last week, the IOC and Japanese organizers postponed the Olympics until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. This year's games were scheduled to open on July 24 and close on Aug. 9. But the near exact one-year delay will see the rescheduled closing ceremony on Aug. 8. There had been talk of switching the Olympics to spring, a move that would coincide with the blooming of Japan's famous cherry blossoms. But it would also clash with European soccer and North American sports leagues. Mori said a spring Olympics was considered but holding the games later gives more space to complete the many qualifying events that have been postponed by the virus outbreak. We wanted to have more room for the athletes to qualify, Mori said.

After holding out for weeks, local organizers and the IOC last week postponed the $T$ Games under pressure from athletes, national Olympic bodies and sports federations. It's the first postponement in Olympic history, though there were several cancellations during wartime. The Paralympics were rescheduled to Aug. 24-Sept. 5. The new Olympic dates would conflict with the scheduled world championships in track and swimming, but those events are now expected to also be pushed back. The IOC has had close discussions with the relevant international committee CEO Toshiro Muto believe the IFs have accepted the games being held in the summer. Muto said the decision was made March 30 and the IOC said it was supported by all the international sports federations and was based on three main considerations to protect the health of athletes, to safeguard the interests of the athletes and Olympic sport, and the international sports calendar.

Manchester United, Arsenal and Real Madrid are all chasing Wolves $T$ Raul Jimenez, but all three have been warned off the Mexican star, according to the Daily Star. Wolves have valued the 28-year-old at 80m which could in itself scare off would-be suitors, but now Wolves' Chinese owners have issued a hands-off warning to anyone thinking of making a move. Jimenez has scored 22 goals in 45 appearances for Wolves and has previously said he'd be happy at Molineux even if he doesn't get the opportunity at Champions League next season. Juventus are trying to fill the sizeable shoes left by right-back Dani Alves in 2017, and now the Bianconeri .

Sometimes in $T$ matches I used to run back to the center of the mat when we went out of bounds just to show my opponent I wasn't tired. Even if I was tired, I'd do it. Imagine being tired and seeing your opponent run back to the center when you're barely halfway through the match. That's demoralizing and can lead a lot of people to quit. Breaking someone in this instance is equal to success. In all of life we're essentially competing against other human beings for work, romantic partners, or even when we go to buy a car from a dealership. I'm successful as a writer because I kept working when many other people hit their breaking point. Because of martial arts, my breaking point kept getting farther and farther away. I stopped quitting so easily because I tested myself every day in practice. Many people do not have this life-changing experience and therefore quit relatively easily when compared to someone who has practiced martial arts.

Normally, the 26-year-old Martinez would be getting ready to join the $T$ for their offseason program. When that will happen now is uncertain. Since agreeing to and finally signing a three-year, $30 million contract in free agency, the former Green Bay Packer hasn't had a chance to do much. He did help his father put the finishing touches on a gym in the basement of his home in Tucson, Arizona. It's where he signed his new contract. His conference call Monday was his first interaction with the New York metropolitan area media since reaching the deal two weeks ago.

But, playing it safe with none out, Williams put up the stop sign, which the runner obeyed. Next batter Willie Upshaw lined a Ward fastball to third baseman Ed Sprague, who not only caught the ball but tagged out a momentarily frozen Moseby for a blink-and-you-missed-it double play.

Lineker is first to admit that he misses sport and understands that people want to see the return to normality as soon as possible, most notably $T$ fans who have been waiting three decades to see their side lift the Premier League trophy. But he also understands that the Covid-19 threat has called a halt to the world's sporting calendar and accepts that there is nothing in his power to bring about the resumption. The truth is, while football is generally important to people's lives, we are dealing with live or death, which is far more important .

The Match of the Day host is convinced that finishing the $T$ season will take precedence over the following campaign, which may be delayed to facilitate the situation that has been brought about by the coronavirus. Everyone has their theories as to what might happen, but I suspect they'll do everything in their power to finish the season in some way, shape or form, said Lineker, speaking on 2fm's Game On.

The heads of Fiorentina and Torino said in separate interviews on Monday that they believed that the $T$ season was unlikely to finish due to the coronavirus pandemic. Italy, which accounts for more than a third of all global fatalities due to COVID-19, saw its total death tally rise to 11,591 on Monday.

Meanwhile, Italy's footballers union -LRB- AIC -RRB- and $T$ clubs postponed talks set for Monday regarding salary cuts and the future of the season. The ANSA news agency quoted league sources as saying that the protracted duration of a previous meeting held by both parties led to the rescheduling. The worry that the leagues are over exists, AIC president Damiano Tommasi told ANSA. We must therefore face the problem of the closure of the season, considering sporting results and contracts, in a formal way.

Italians have been under lockdown for $T$ weeks and Serie A, like all major football competitions around the world, is at a standstill with no indication of when it may restart. Let's think about health now, we'll talk about football later, Fiorentina owner Rocco Commisso told state broadcaster RAI in a radio interview. We'll see if we can get back to training. But there's a serious possibility that the championship won't end. His Torino counterpart Urbano Cairo said that, even if teams could start training again in May, there would not be time to complete the championship. That would mean starting training at the end of May and then starting the games at the end of June, playing in July and August, he told another RAI radio channel. Then give everyone a month off, a month to train and you would not start the next championship before November. He was against awarding the title.

In a bid to jump start $T$ that all but disappeared during the outbreak, authorities in some places are distributing vouchers, asking companies to give people paid time off and offering subsidies on larger purchases like cars.

But many Chinese are still hesitant to return to their old lives. worried about whether safe to go outside and financial pressures as unemployment spikes.

The lukewarm response to the $T$ campaign is a cautionary tale for governments around the world who are hoping for a quick recovery once lockdowns are lifted. The hurdles China now faces are likely to arise elsewhere. In Zhejiang, companies have been encouraged to give employees an extra half day of paid leave once a week in the hope use the free time to shop and spend. Chen Xin, an interior designer based in the capital, benefit from the measure. She works for a small company of 20 people that afford it after losing business because of the virus. I would be grateful just to keep my job, said Chen.

For my colleagues and I, we are still $T$ at home as much as possible. Going to public places feel safe. Images of bureaucrats dining out and shopping are a sharp departure from the austerity that resulted from President Xi unprecedented anti-corruption crackdown, which made many cadres scared to be caught doing anything that could be construed as ostentatious. China needs to get the biggest consumer market spending again now that its outbreak has been officially contained. Retail sales plunged 20.5 in the first two months of the year and almost half of listed retailers have enough cash to survive another six months. While the commerce ministry said Thursday that retail sales have stopped falling, the recovery is fragile with economy already facing a second blow from a drop in overseas demand and many people out of jobs or having their wages cut.

The middle-weight $T$ who has qualified for the Tokyo Olympics in the 75kg category, initially had no interest in boxing or in any other sport, for that matter. Pooja took to boxing when she was 18 years of age. That too quite by chance. To be honest, sport did not interest me. Not boxing, not anything else, Pooja told The Telegraph from her home in Bhiwani, Haryana, where she has just finished serving the mandatory two-week self-isolation after returning from the Asia-Oceania Boxing qualifiers in Amman, Jordan. In college, given my height -LRB- 1.70m -RRB-, I was selected to take part in an inter-college competition and ended up with a silver That was the first time I had taken part in boxing and without any preparation as such. It kindled an interest in me for the sport.

However, it was not all smooth sailing for Pooja thereafter. The first obstacle came in the form of her father, who was then with Haryana police. My dad was vehemently against my becoming a pugilist. Any other sport but not he insisted. Why not some other sport Why not maybe basketball he kept telling me. He was sure I would injure myself and get disfigured. Boxing toh gundey log karte hain -LRB- Boxing is for he kept telling me. Gradually, as I started winning tournaments, my attitude started to change.

It seems to be that this $T$ is a little bit hardier or a little more resistant to some of the external forces that might cause it to degrade, he says. I think influenza is a lot more susceptible to changes in temperature and humidty. But I think this is a really good starting point. While it's far from settled science, evidence has emerged that the coronavirus prefers dry conditions. Data collected by Nanjing University from more than 500 locations across the globe since late January suggests weather, including relative humidity, is a factor in the spread of the contagion. Researchers from universities in Madrid and Helsinki are also reporting that tropical parts of the globe seem least affected.

Today, $T$ also published new data modeling the most recent SEER statistics in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers Prevention, showing that if all cancers currently diagnosed at stage IV could be diagnosed earlier, evenly distributed across stages I-III, cancer deaths could fall by These findings support the potential significant public health benefit of an accurate and highly specific multi-cancer early detection test. The Human Genome Project ushered in the era of precision medicine, but the benefits have largely impacted patients with specific mutations or genetic diseases.

In the sub-study reported in publication results from the validation set showed that proprietary targeted methylation technology achieved high specificity or a single low false positive rate of less than across more than 50 cancer types. The detection rate for a pre-specified set of 12 deadly cancer types, that together account for approximately 63 of U.S. cancer deaths annually, was 67.3 across stages I-III -LRB- 95 confidence interval CI The overall detection rate for all cancer types was 43.9 across stages I-III -LRB- 95 CI When a cancer signal was detected, a tissue of origin result was provided for 96 of the samples, and of these, the test correctly identified the tissue of origin in 93 of cases.

We are election officials in $T$ states that require us to offer an online method to some of our voters. For these voters, the argument is not an academic one, but an issue of necessity traditional voting methods simply work for those living abroad, deployed in the military or those with disabilities.

As election officials, our duty to stand up for the constitutional rights of our citizens, whatever their circumstances, and the reality is that online voting dramatically improves the opportunities for these $T$ groups to engage with our democracy. We should not be debating whether online voting should exist, but rather asking What is the most secure way to facilitate electronic voting Because already being done. And because it's needed by some voting groups -- whose volume might expand in the near future. As a country, we currently have three million eligible voters living abroad, and only 7 cast ballots in the 2016 elections, according to the Federal Voting Assistance biennial Overseas Citizen Population Analysis.

This same analysis found that removing logistical barriers to voting would raise participation by A different analysis separately found that while nearly one million active-duty military are eligible to vote, only around $T$ of them actually did in 2018. The traditional system of mailed-in absentee ballots and centralized polling places is failing these voters, and they alone among the disenfranchised. The turnout story is also grim for the 35 million U.S. voters with disabilities. An October 2017 Government Accountability Office report also found widespread barriers to disabled voting, such as machines that could have made it impossible to cast votes privately.

no wonder that, as a 2017 Rutgers University study found, disabled voting participation has declined in each of the last $T$ presidential elections, dropping from 57.3 in 2008 to 55.9 in 2016. New technologies offer promise to expanding and securing access for overseas citizens and voters with disabilities. Consider MacCene Grimmett, who is, at 106, oldest voter. When she was born in 1913, women did not have the right to vote.

In the $T$ st century, that will necessarily include electronic methods, particularly as we face challenges with voters abroad and contemplate emerging challenges at home like COVID-19, where large public gatherings and long lines spark new threats to consider. We must continue trials and experiments to broaden access for voters, while hardening the system and making it more resilient, and that means beginning with small-scale pilots, seeing what works, stringently auditing the results and then employing that knowledge in new rounds of testing. App-based voting, for example, is already more secure than returning a ballot by email, and it also preserves voter anonymity in a way that email makes impossible -LRB- because whoever opens the email to hand-copy the vote onto a paper ballot for tabulation knows who sent it -RRB-. These are the everyday successes that internet-based voting is producing right now. And they ought to be driving the discussion as we move forward slowly, responsibly and confidently.

Inside casinos, wads of U.S. hundred-dollar bills pile up in batches of $10,000 beside white marble ashtrays. Outside, streets are coated in fine orange dust and pedestrians cross rivulets of sewage on scraps of plywood. It's a disconnect familiar to anyone who lives on China's margins. China exclaims Gavin Gao, a gleeful young Chinese tech entrepreneur from Chengdu who has chosen to stick things out.

ASSOCIATED PRESS As of today, $T$ of U.S. governors have issued statewide stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders in an effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, but President Trump says he's not inclined to order a national travel ban. It's pretty unlikely at this time, said the president during today's coronavirus task force press briefing in the White House Rose Garden. We're letting the governors do in their states pretty much what they want, with our supervision. Obviously, there are parts of the country that are in far deeper trouble than others, he said. Other parts are frankly not in trouble at all and hopefully we're going to be able to keep it that way by doing what we're doing. Since Saturday, a majority of governors have issued executive orders mandating that residents stay at home. As pressure has mounted on the holdouts, the total number of states in shutdown mode has risen to 32.

I very much doubt that this is a situation that those supporting right to repair would have expected, but I would argue that the current situation is one where the ability for third-party repair shops to have access to the knowledge and tools will help support social distancing while allowing $T$ to stay connected. Not every repair is going to be a smashed screen. There may be issues with the contact behind a button, issues with blown capacitors and electrical connections that need soldering, data recovery, and out of warranty machines that can be repaired using working parts adopted from unrepairable handsets. All of these repairs, and more, are possible. But they need suitable support from the manufacturers, not just Apple, but across the board.

Regardless of whether coronavirus happened or not, Kevin would have acquired the company, said $T$ CEO David Siegel, who has known Ryan for 20 years, since he worked for the investor at DoubleClick. He has more confidence in the underlying business dynamic. A time of widespread social lockdown may seem like an odd time to buy a business based on getting people together, with more than 49 million members globally who before social distancing mandates participated in about 15,000 in-person events daily. The company collects revenue from fees paid by members to organizers of interest-groups, who meet for activities such as hiking or walking, or to learn how to use javascript. It also has an enterprise product for business and entrepreneur meetings, which counts Adobe, Google, Microsoft Azure, IBM and Twitter among its clients.

But after WeWork's implosion last year, $T$ was forced to restructure and shed 25 of its workforce. Since then, it has attempted to chart its way forward and find a new owner. Then coronavirus hit at the core of its business, leading Siegel to start hosting online meetings using video conferences. He said WeWork poured a lot of money into the business at times too much which may have kept the company from refining its product before scaling, including its move to online meetings. Making those changes is now a priority, including allowing gatherings to occur online using video chat rooms.

To husband its cash even further, $T$ plans to also cut marketing, technology, and operations spending while stores remain closed.

Of more concern to shareholders, $T$ will also suspend share repurchases temporarily and is even evaluating its dividend program. That last one may shock investors the most -- but it's hardly surprising.

With much less revenue coming in now that the stores are closed, $T$ is certainly wondering whether it might have a better use for that cash, and the company's recent decision to draw down its $1 billion revolving credit facility in full is probably sharpening management's focus.

Due to a shortage of materials to make the masks, Simpsons is currently unable to mass produce their idea. If they can straighten out the wrinkles with the prototype and purchase supplies when they are in stock, Simpsons is more than happy to help.

Our technology enables us to optimise delivery processes by combining data from external sources such as road conditions and weather with real-time data collected by Internet of Things devices across our $T$ fleet. By regrouping scattered bookings, we are able to generate higher utilisation in round-trip loads and reduce waste for our customers. The company currently has more than 100 enterprise customers, including Coca-Cola, OPPO, Asia Brewery, as well as global manufacturers, telecom providers and distributors. Inteluck will use the fresh funds to launch an intelligent dispatch system and expand its customer base in the Philippines. It is also planning to expand to other markets in South-east Asia.

Only $T$ percent of the land that drains toward the huge lake is used for agriculture, while eighty percent of the watershed is open water and wetlands. Most of the lake's tributaries in the Minnesota portion of the watershed meet state standards for water quality. Yet cyanobacteria in the lake seem to be a bigger problem every year. That's why we're here on this cold and lonely trip. By placing sensors in the lake for almost the whole open-water season, scientists can see when blooms happen, what the water is like before, during and after a bloom, and much more.

Unlike most $T$ lakes with cyanobacteria problems, Lake of the Woods is not surrounded by farm fields or cities that dump large amounts of nutrients into its water. This is wild country comprised of bogs and lakes, forests and rivers.

Once Mark finally gets hold of the line, the $T$ begins. Mark hangs over the side of the boat, pulling on the yellow line connected to the high-tech instruments and the anchors. He drags them aboard, everything covered in slimy algae. Mud and algae now freeze to the boat along with the ice. It can be an intense and challenging process, but everything is eventually brought aboard. Then Mark collects water samples while Adam uses an instrument loaded with all kinds of water quality sensors to take a spot check of conditions at the site. Constant data collection The first site gives us everything the lake has to offer ice and waves, cold and wind. After wrapping up there, it is another five miles to the second site, another half-hour hunched against the wind. When we get there, the sun begins to set and the challenges are no longer novel. We circle the spot, Mark throws the hook again and again, and then pulls equipment aboard, performing complicated tasks with frozen fingers.

Each $T$ exists as a virtual speck a set of GPS coordinates and as a physical manifestation contraptions consisting of sensors connected by yellow polypropylene ropes, submerged and anchored at or near that location. The buoys have nothing above the water, but there is a float at the top of the rope, a few feet below the surface. The bright yellow line goes down through the water to cement blocks on the bottom. Tied on at various depths are sensors and sediment traps. The first job when arriving at the coordinates is to find the thing. Once a month all summer, Adam, Mark, and a rotating crew of helpers visited the sites, downloading data and collecting samples. On a sunny day with relatively clear water, the crew could sometimes see the float through the water as soon as they arrived. Swerving and snagging The low angle of the late October sun, the gray skies, and the waves, make it impossible to see below the surface. We hope to spot the float pop out in the trough of a wave, but that does not happen.

When we are close, he tosses the hook overboard, hoping to snag one of the lines on the submerged buoy.

And, crucially, even though paper mills and sewage treatment plants have largely stopped dumping nutrients into it since the 1970s, $T$ is still plagued by cyanobacteria blooms that turn the water green and possibly toxic. Cyanobacteria are ancient organisms billions of years old, they were the first forms of life to use energy from the sun. They're found almost everywhere on Earth, in harmless low numbers. But when they burst into a big bloom, driven by nutrients, weather, and other forces, they cause big problems.

Most of them convey the same message containment puts $T$ in front of themselves. Suddenly, they have all the time they asked for. Suddenly, they even feel like they have too much time. This process frees up time for moments of reflection, and therefore of awareness. Suddenly, we have time to think. And thinking tends to refocus us. At least, this is what happened to me. As I observe myself spending my days, the things that I care about magically highlight by themselves. The things that I inherently like doing. It made me realize that a certain form of pressure was what made me feel the need to go out every single day .

Vapor intrusion occurs when contamination moves from $T$ and soil beneath a structure into the air, accumulating in occupied areas where they can result in safety hazards or health effects. Common vapor-forming chemicals include volatile organic compounds including trichloroethylene -LRB- TCE -RRB-, mercury, polychlorinated biphenyl -LRB- PCB -RRB-, and certain pesticides. Testing for vapor intrusion is an important step in investigating a potential development site, and in ensuring the health and safety of existing residential and commercial buildings. The Supplemental Guidance, which was developed collaboratively by the Department of Toxic Substances Control -LRB- DTSC -RRB-, the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, and the State Water Resources Control Board, is intended to increase the consistency of testing methods.

Yet, perhaps, the words form a symbol for which an invading settler may understand, as the brevity of such words provides no understanding, initially, to the sacred ideology of the Ute.

The influence of world through the possession of sacred knowledge, by those who lack initiated understanding threatens Ute existence through a bitter history with invading settlers.

The challenge of blue corn, and its $T$ in a desert, as Schaafsma writes, are essential to the success of maize-growing farmers, and hence a life of abundance. This further suggests the prevalence of symbolic depiction of the essential respect for ancestral pre-existing life as critical among cultures for subsidence and survival. Hopi way of life not only revolves around the reverence and respect for ancestral tradition as sacred, but also humility as one lives a challenging life, in the ways of their ancestors.

Sacred principles, as with the Hopi sooya additionally form as physical embodiments of spiritual principles, such as the subterranean constructs called $T$ s. A report of the Hopi ceremonial practices of passage involving the symbolic meaning of initiation in Kivas, published in 2009 to the journal American Antiquities, adds The sipaapuni, the small excavation often located in the kiva floor, further symbolizes the place of emergence -LRB- Schaffsma -RRB-. Spiritual meaning, much like the the sooya , additionally presents itself physically as the sipaapuni , the physical emergence from darkness, into the partially lit kiva floor.
Kiva

The unknown darkness which exists as the inner portal of the sipaapuni serves to remind one within the inner $T$ of the relative darkness within their own perceptual environments. This concept intensifies with the emergence from the kiva, into the brightly lit world above, ultimately representing ideas of cyclical rebirth and change towards a more dominant light of continuation and progress towards the light. Thus the connotation for a young boy inside the subterranean structure as a rite of passage, with a single light beam emanating from the portal above, depicts the importance of choice, decisions, and the responsibility for the decisions thereafter.

Unsurprisingly, rather than illustrate a lesson for essential human behavior, historical texts become further misunderstood with varying interpretations of ambiguous terms with unknown application. This sets a dangerous precedent for complete destruction of symbolic meaning within cultural origins of America, seen with the accreditation of monumental petroglyphs and ruins to a non-human origin. Coinciding anomalous details of the archaeological record remain poorly understood in part by ethnographic antiquities studies of the late European Enlightenment, which cultural tensions excelled between Native American populations and colonists from Europe.

As such, the archival body of artifactual data, known as the Archaeological is an available source of $T$ for academics interested in establishing a firmly set narrative about Native history in the Western Hemisphere yet, the historical connotation one may perceive from the partial published archaeological data would be considered a misconception of history, due to the lack of the intentional, original, perceived meaning which instilled a culture, described through the artifactual remnants resistant to weathering. This is clear, as the narrative that Native people, have no relevant history, an idea held among scholars and a majority of Americans who maintain the belief that the indigenous people of their land have long since died out intentionally, or justified through chance pervades the heart of American universities. As a result of this mentality, the volume of data collected in such large quantities since the 19th century, become less understood through a progressively unfit puzzle of a narrative.

Understandably, such artefactual knowledge loses sacred meaning for Native people, when individuals seek knowledge of a culture with ambiguous intent to use such $T$ in a manner void of cultural and physical application of sacred understanding. As an individual without access to sacred knowledge, the speculation remains that it rightfully exists within their cultural domain. The Acoma Puebloan people of New Mexico employ a similar approach towards the divulsion of their historical understanding. The 2008 UXL Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes lists, The Acoma maintain a great deal of secrecy about their spiritual traditions. Their chief gods are Ocatc -LRB- the Sun, who is called and Iatiku -LRB- the mother of all Indians -RRB-.

Alternative mythologies as this, devoid of sacred cultural meaning, exist without the context of the indigenous cultures symbolic understanding of artifactual symbols and, risks the loss of culture behind the sacred symbols prevalent within the diversity of $T$ American existences. Additionally, contentious cultural interactions often occur due to ethnographic bias, the perceptual analysis of unfamiliar phenomena related to individual subjective experience, and invariably exists innately within all humans. For scholars, academics, or simply anyone interested in the understanding indigenous American culture, thought, and the multitude of cultural diversity within, one should consider the conserved symbolism which defines a culture through sacred principles.

Symbols, aside from language alone, through their prevalence in $T$ culture, allow a deeper understanding for how sacred reflects the behavior and culture of indigenous people, rooted in the ancient synthesis of ancestral communication. Ultimately, through the analysis of the characteristic symbols, whether physical, or ideological, one can define a cultural identity in a region.

Additionally, understanding the sacred as it exists to a $T$ culture generates a fuller understanding of the sacred as it is conserved through symbols and cultural diversity. Symbols persevere into all elements of human behavior, as they form the basis of written and spoken language, and the landscapes which symbolic medium may represent. Sociologically, and most generally, Meaning is generated in a system when different pieces of information are related as messages to one another -LRB- Leydesdorff 191 -RRB-. Among other domains, symbols exist primarily within documentations of the indigenous origin stories of America, and the cultural practices. As such, to any analytical attempt of understanding the historical past, indigenous people and their ancestors should be understood, within the symbolic mediums to instruct indigenous ways of life.

Concepts of the sacred, particularly the sacred element of knowledge, ancestral reverence, and perseverance, depicted among symbols variously documented in $T$ mythology and folklore, offer guidance towards an appreciation of how indigenous people incorporate and consider sacred ideology within knowledge. This is because symbols often represent of the natural world, distinct ideas and concepts relevant to human perception which retain flexibility in their instructional role through generations. The physical contexts, such as location in which a story of an origin or creation myth occurs, critically determine the meaning behind a story, which additionally maintains importance towards the establishment of symbolic cultural values that enable the survival and endurance of a people -LRB- Leydesdorff 193 -RRB-.

$T$ traditional oral mythology functions similarly to written historical text in potential for description of prior events, yet variably serves a distinct purpose of instructional behavior, dependent on the context which a speaker tells a story.

Coinciding anomalous details of the archaeological record remain poorly understood in part by ethnographic antiquities studies of the late European Enlightenment, which cultural tensions excelled between $T$ American populations and colonists from Europe. Moving forward, a synthesis of the documented symbolic motifs among the indigenous people of North America, would provide at least a framework for a progressive, respectfully non-invasive -LRB- to sacred knowledge -RRB-, unbiased, and politically refreshed analysis of the past. Perhaps American materialistic culture and the individuals within, may discover the value towards symbolic meaning as it pertains to the continuation of one's familial existence.

The media credits such primary physical evidence, usually a discovery that exists outside of $T$ historical context, to some form of extra-terrestrial contact, an arguably racist and dangerously popular target for misconception of native history. As of December 2018, a Google search reveals that the most popular of such media television series broadcast to the public since 2009 has 13 seasons, with 149 episodes.

The $T$ however, has opened up an entirely different problem the life-endangering consequences of supposed cures, misleading claims, snake-oil sales pitches and conspiracy theories. A mass of rumors and myths about the virus has been debunked, but experts said stronger action from tech companies is needed to stop misinformation spreading online. There's still a disconnect between what people think is true and what people are willing to share, said David Rand, a specialist in brain and cognitive sciences at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Part of the reason is that social media algorithms are geared to appeal to someone's habits and interests the emphasis is on likability, not accuracy.

Prompts urging users to consider the accuracy of content they are spreading on social networks are needed, said Rand, co-author of a new study on $T$ misinformation. Using controlled tests with more than 1,600 participants, the study found false claims were shared in part simply because people failed to think about whether the content was reliable. In a second test, when people were reminded to consider the accuracy of what they are going to share, their level of truth awareness more than doubled. That approach - known as accuracy nudge intervention - from social media firms could limit the spread of misinformation. These are the kind of things that make the concept of accuracy top of the minds of people, said Rand, noting that news feeds are instead filled by users' own content and commercial ads.
